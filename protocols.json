    "content": "NOTE: This protocol applies to all EMS calls.\nRESPOND TO SCENE IN A SAFE MANNER:\nReview dispatch information.\nUse lights and sirens and/or pre-emptive devices when responding as appropriate per emergency medical dispatch information and local guidelines.\nSCENE ARRIVAL AND SIZE-UP:\nUtilize Body Substance Isolation (BSI), and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as appropriate.\nAssess scene safety, bystander safety.\nAssess for weapons of mass destruction (WMD), odors/fumes, cultural/social factors, active shooter hostile event response (ASHER), and environmental hazards, as applicable. Determine number of patients. Determine nature of illness/mechanism of injury/illness (NOI/MOI). Determine need for additional/specialized resources. Activate air-medical transport early and if applicable to do so. Utilize Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) and/or Incident Command System (ICS) procedures as applicable.\nPATIENT APPROACH:\nBring all necessary equipment to the patient in order to function at your level of certification and up to the level of the ambulance service license. Begin assessment and care at the side of the patient; avoid delay. Determine if a valid MOLST order or Comfort Care/DNR Verification form is in place, and act accordingly. Form a general impression of patient acuity, determine patient priority, and request advanced life support (ALS) if appropriate. The presumption is, DO NOT allow sick or injured patients to walk or otherwise exert themselves. Use safe and proper lifts and carries with appropriate devices to extricate patients to the ambulance stretcher. Patient conditions which can be exacerbated with exertion include, but not limited to, cardiac, respiratory, neurological, trauma and those patients with abnormal vital signs. Unique circumstances and any deviations from this principle must be clearly described in the Patient Care Report (PCR) and the service must have an internal continuous quality improvement (CQI) process to review each such case. For patients who are minors: In an emergency, EMS personnel may assess and treat without consent of a parent or legal guardian. Consent to emergency medical care is implied. If the parent or guardian is on scene, EMS personnel must explain what assessment and care they are providing. Note that only a parent or legal guardian may refuse care for a patient who is a minor, unless the minor is emancipated in accordance with Protocol 7.5 Refusal of Medical Care and Transportation. There is no such regulatory concept as a “lift-assist call.” Under 105 CMR 170.345 of the EMS System regulations, each EMS call – including but not limited to those cases in which no treatment is provided, the patient refuses treatment and there is no transport – a PCR must be documented. When EMS is dispatched to a patient who is requesting a “lift assist,” EMS must complete and document an appropriate patient assessment on a PCR. If the patient is not transported, then an informed refusal must be documented, in accordance with Protocol 7.5 Refusal of Medical Care and Transportation, and included in the PCR.\nASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PRIORITIES\nDetermine unresponsiveness, absence of breathing and pulselessness; Initiate high quality CPR with minimal interruptions in chest compressions for patients found to be in cardiac arrest and in the absence of a MOLST/CC/DNR. Determine patient’s hemodynamic stability, signs and symptoms, level of consciousness, vital signs to include airway, breathing, circulation, disabilities/differential diagnosis, exposure/ environmental (ABCDE). Identify/manage life threats, maintain an open airway and assist ventilations as needed. If basic life support (BLS) airway management is not sufficient, consider the use of advanced airway interventions as appropriate and if trained to do so. Administer supplemental oxygen using the appropriate delivery device, if indicated. When using a bag-valve mask (BVM) on pediatric patients, the BVM should deliver PEEP at 5 cm H O. 2 Ventilation rates are to be titrated to goal end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) recommendations. 2 Avoid hyperoxygenation; oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition and administered with evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO2< 90%, especially in the presence of a suspected CVA/TIA or ACS. Use quantitative, recordable waveform capnography, for all patients with advanced airway interventions and consider its use with all respiratory compromised conditions. The capnography waveform must be recorded on all patients with endotracheal or supraglottic airways in place and clinically significant data attached to the patient care report for the receiving facility. EMTs that are properly trained and authorized, and AEMTs placing a supraglottic airway, also must use waveform capnography. In patients who are not in cardiac arrest, all efforts should be made to avoid ETCO levels that have been shown to be detrimental and to ensure quality ventilation and 2 oxygenation. In general this means ETCO values should be kept between 35-45 mm Hg in these 2 patients; specific exceptions should be discussed with online medical control. As soon as clinically appropriate (generally at first patient contact) and if within your scope of practice, apply the cardiac monitor and obtain a 12-lead ECG tracing. If within your scope of practice, obtain peripheral vascular access via intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) on all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with shock or who are hemodynamically compromised, or have the potential to become compromised. For pediatric patients, a 20ml kg fluid bolus if applicable. When obtaining IO access in adult patients able to perceive pain, administer lidocaine 40 mg over two minutes, followed by a 10 mL fluid bolus over five seconds (may be administered in two separate bolus). In pediatrics, 1 mg kg of lidocaine to a maximum of 20 mg. IO may be placed in any generally accepted site for which the appropriate levels of provider are trained and properly equipped. Patients who may be in need of medications for conditions such as, but not limited to, nausea or pain should also have IV access established if possible to do so. Obtain venous blood samples according to receiving hospital policies. In a critical patient with no other vascular access, if trained to do so and with concurrent on-line medical control (OLMC) order (OLMC need not be contacted for a patient in cardiac arrest), Paramedics may access a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) line, tunneled and/or non-tunneled externally accessible central catheters, in order to administer fluids or medications. At a minimum, monitor and document vital signs every 15 minutes on stable patients and every 5 minutes for patients with critical conditions. Conduct a thorough assessment of the present illness or injury, onset, provocation, quality, radiation, severity, time (O-P-Q-R-S-T.) Routine Patient Care 1.0 ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PRIORITIES (Continued)\n• Obtain a complete medical history; signs/symptoms, allergies, medication, past medical history, last in and out, events leading and risk factors (S-A-M-P-L-E-R)- associated symptoms pertinent negatives (ASPN)\n• Obtain additional field diagnostic testing when clinically indicated, and if available; (not limited to) blood glucose, pulse oximetry, temperature, carbon monoxide, stroke scale. A service may use blood analyzer equipment in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.\n• Administer medications in accordance with the specific patient condition and scope of practice.\n• Contact medical control for all procedures outside the provisions of standing orders, which may include repeat doses of medications within the standing orders.\n• Follow service or regional policies for all radio or communication failures.\n• Contact the receiving hospital to provide a clear and concise report on the patient’s condition, all interventions, findings, and estimated time of arrival to the receiving department.\n• Continually reassess all patients, especially after any interventions and/or medication administration.\n• EMS personnel should not begin or administer interventions that would require formal medical assessment and care if a patient is being brought to an environment where formal medical assessment and care will not be provided; for example, giving IV narcotics to a patient who is about to be left at home.\n• Based on EMS assessment, a patient may qualify to be treated under multiple treatment protocols.\n• Pediatric patients are defined as those patients who weigh up to 40 kg and are 14 years of age or younger unless specified in the particular protocol.\nAMBULANCE STRETCHER OPERATIONS\n• Operate the ambulance stretcher in accordance with your service training and manufacturer’s specifications at all times.\n• When moving a patient on the ambulance stretcher, adjust the height of the ambulance stretcher down from the “load position” to a safe position for travel.\n• All EMTs moving the patient must keep both hands on the ambulance stretcher whenever it is in “load position” or in motion. Properly secure all patients using the required straps, including the over-the-shoulder harness, hip and leg restraining straps.\n• If patient care requires the removal of any of the restraining straps, re-secure them as soon as practical to do so.\n• Pediatric patients are to be transported in a properly secured child transport device/seat if spinal injury is not suspected (See Protocol 7.4 Pediatric Transport for more information.)The device must be secured to a rigid structure, such as the ambulance stretcher, not to another human body.\nPATIENT CARE REPORTS AND DATA COLLECTION\n• The EMS System regulations require an accurate, concise and properly documented PCR to be completed at the time of the call or as soon as practicable afterwards for all patient encounters. Pertinent data must be left at the receiving hospital at the time of transport. The regulations also require that PCRs include the minimum required data elements, as defined by the Administrative Requirement (A/R 5-403).\n• EMS personnel dispatched to an EMS call in a certified ambulance of any class (Class I through V) must always complete an appropriately documented patient care report. This is required under 105 CMR 170.345 of the EMS System regulations. See last bullet under Patient Approach, above.\n• Clinically relevant data must be conveyed to an appropriate clinical representative of the receiving institution before leaving the receiving facility, ideally using a structured hand-off method.\nPATIENT CARE REPORTS AND DATA COLLECTION (CONT.)\n• All patient care reports must include clinically relevant ECG monitoring tracings, 12-lead tracings, and waveform capnography tracings when obtained.\n• Additional data elements may be collected as per the protocols or at the request of the Affiliate Hospital Medical Director. This data may pertain to, but is not limited to, trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke and infectious disease processes.\nMEDICATION USE AND STORAGE\n• Medications may be administered in divided doses up to the maximum dose noted in a protocol.\nSome medications have a weight-based dose maximum; divided doses up to that patient’s maximum weight-based dose are permitted.\n• Securely maintain and store all medications and fluids at the appropriate temperatures as designated by manufacturer’s recommendations and in accordance with all Drug Control Program regulations.\n• Pharmaceutical shortages and supply chain issues have become more frequent. Whenever a medication is temporarily not obtainable in typical dosage forms as called for in the Statewide Treatment Protocols, or in any form, substitute concentrations and substitute medications may be used, in accordance with Advisory 22-08-01. All such temporary substitutions must be approved by the service's affiliate hospital medical director and affiliate hospital's pharmacy director, with a date of expiration for the temporary substitution authorized, and meeting all other requirements of this Advisory.\n• All EMS personnel and ambulance services must adhere to all advisories, memos and administrative requirements issued by the Department.\n• IV pumps are the preferred method of administering vasoactive medications. Norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions must be administered via pump. If an ambulance does not have an infusion pump, consult medical control for preferred alternatives such as a fluid bolus or Dopamine administration. Paramedics with the equipment and training may begin using pumps immediately. Dopamine may be used until the pump is available.\nEXCEPTION PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTOCOLS\n• The Statewide Treatment Protocols reflect the current state of out-of-hospital emergency medical care, as such, should serve as the basis for EMS treatment.\n• On occasion, good medical practice and the needs of patient care may require deviations from these protocols, as no protocol can anticipate every clinical situation. In those circumstances, EMS personnel deviating from the protocols should only take such actions as allowed by their training and only in conjunction with their on-line medical control physician.\n• Any such deviations must be reviewed by the appropriate local medical director, but for regulatory purposes are considered to be appropriate actions, and therefore within the scope of the protocols, unless determined otherwise on Department review by the State EMS Medical Director.\n• The Exception Principle applies only to exceptions from the Statewide Treatment Protocols, for real-time care of a specific individual patient. It does NOT apply to exceptions from the EMS statue, and regulations; Department approved point-of-entry plans, Administrative Requirements and Advisories. It does NOT apply to operational issues, such as ambulance staffing, or deployment, equipment failures, lack of par levels of medications; or transport decisions deviating from the EMS regulations or point-of-entry plan requirements. These are outside the authority of medical control.\nADVANCED AIRWAY CONFIRMATION\n• Advanced EMT and Paramedic treatment protocols require that EMTs provide advanced airway management when BLS airway management is not sufficient, and is clinically indicated. Specific training and airway adjuncts are necessary and require training in accordance with scope of practice and service specific devices.\n• Endotracheal tube insertion and supraglottic airway (SGA) devices are commonly used in patients that require advanced airway management. Airway devices must be secured, with depth noted as appropriate.\n• In cardiac arrest only, EMTs at the basic level of certification may consider inserting a supraglottic airway when basic airway maneuvers are not sufficient. To do so EMTs must have completed skill specific training in SGA and in the use of airway adjuncts, including waveform capnography, in accordance with scope of practice and service specific devices.\n• All Paramedics must be able to insert NGT/OGT for those unconscious post-intubation patients who need gastric decompression. Routine Patient Care\nADVANCED AIRWAY CONFIRMATION (Continued)\nThe standard of care requires specific methods of verification to be used including capnography and at least two of the following; auscultation, visualization of the chords, the presence of condensation, and other clinical signs that the advanced airway is positioned correctly. Documentation on the PCR must include at least three evidence based methods of verification of advanced airway placement (For paramedics, one being recorded capnography) and must include at least three separate times in which verification was completed, including verification of tube placement at the time of arrival at the receiving department and staff. For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with the insertion of an appropriately sized oropharyngeal airway (OPA) with BVM ventilation with PEEP at 5 cm H2O or a SGA. In some cases, intubation may be preferred when other airway management methods are insufficient. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.\nTRANSPORT DECISION\n• Transport to the nearest appropriate health care facility as defined in EMS regulations. In rare circumstances, delayed transport may occur when treatment cannot be performed during transport.\n• Request and use available advanced life support (ALS) – Paramedic resources in accordance with these protocols. Initiate transport as soon as possible, with or without ALS.\n• EMS personnel shall make decisions about the destination hospital in accordance with the EMS System regulations and Department-approved point-of-entry (POE) plans.\n• There are currently Department-approved condition-specific POE plans for trauma, stroke and STEMI, as well as a POE based on a patient’s specific other condition or need, not covered in the specific POE plans. Department-approved regional POE plans for trauma; stroke and STEMI identify specific hospitals to be used. EMS personnel must be aware of all these POE plans affecting his/her service when choosing the appropriate hospital destination. EMS personnel should call on-line Medical Control (OLMC) if they have a question about POE.\n• A patient who is in cardiac arrest, cannot be oxygenated or ventilated, or is otherwise critically unstable due to issues not amenable to EMS intervention, should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital in accordance with the EMS System regulations and Department-approved\nPOE.\n• Notify receiving facility as early as possible on a recorded phone line or recorded radio.\n• The use of lights and sirens should be justified by the need for immediate medical intervention that is beyond the capabilities of the ambulance crew using available supplies and equipment.\n• Hospital diversion of EMS traffic is not permitted in Massachusetts. Hospitals may only refuse an ambulance if they are completely closed to all patients including walk-in patients (see Department’s “Code Black” Memorandum, issued October 16, 2020: (https://www.mass.gov/lists/emergency- department-circular-letters.) Under this “Code Black” Memorandum, hospitals are required to notify EMS in the event of certain services being unavailable, and EMS may take that unavailability into account when deciding on “nearest appropriate” health care facility.\n• Unavailable Service Notification is defined in the Memorandum as a communication by a hospital to ambulance services of a temporary change in the Emergency Department capabilities. An unavailable service notification should be communicated to ambulance services if and only if any of the following operational conditions exist, closure of the operating room, lack of CT scan services, and closure of interventional cardiac catheterization lab.\nCONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI)\n• The Department’s Hospital Licensure regulations for medical control service (105 CMR 130.1501- 1504) require that hospital physicians providing medical direction must be knowledgeable in the communication system and its usage and must know the Statewide Treatment Protocols for each level of EMT.\n• Medical directors for ambulance services must take an active role in reviewing clinical performance and competency of its EMTs at all levels in the delivery of patient care and in overseeing and conducting the ambulance service’s CQI process.\n• Ambulance services with their affiliate hospital medical director (AHMD) must develop and implement a comprehensive and dynamic CQI program in accordance with the ambulance service’s affiliation agreement.\n• An ambulance service that has AHMD approval to use certain optional diagnostic and treatment modalities must do so in accordance with Section 6: Medical Director Options and its program specific CQI requirements. The AHMD is responsible for overseeing of such programs and ensuring the ambulance service meets the CQI requirements and the Department data reporting requirements.",

Place an oral or nasal airway, when appropriate to do so. Ventilation / oxygenation options, as per most recent AHA/ILCOR recommendations.\nEMT STANDING ORDERS\nWhile resuscitation is ongoing, assess if the patient is tolerating the SGA well, by evidence of waveform capnography, good chest rise, bilateral breath sounds, and improved oxygenation. Do not stop or delay resuscitation to assess SGA; if in doubt, remove and continue with BVM ventilations.\nADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS\nA • Place IV/IO without interrupting chest compressions\nPEARLS:\nIt is expected, unless special circumstances are present, initial 8 minutes of resuscitation will be performed on scene. Early CPR and defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care. Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain. Recognizing the goal of immediate uninterrupted chest compressions, consider delaying application of mechanical CPR devices until after the first four cycles (8 minutes). If applied during the first 4 cycles, the goal is to limit interruptions. Mechanical devices should only be used by services that are practiced and skilled at their application. Switch compressors frequently to minimize fatigue. Hover hands over the chest: Compress when charging and resume compressions immediately after the shock is delivered.\nPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS\n• Monitor quantitative waveform capnography throughout resuscitation to assess CPR quality and to monitor for signs of a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC.)\n• Provide manual defibrillation as indicated, as per AHA/ILCOR.\n• Consider an advanced airway such as an endotracheal intubation or alternative airway.\nwithout interrupting chest compressions.\nIn accordance with protocol 6.8 Automated Transport Ventilators(ATV), Paramedics may use ATV in rate control mode with the following settings: Rate of 8-12 breaths per minute Tidal volume 300-500mL\n• Start at FiO 1.0 (100%) then titrate to maintain SpO > 94% (90% for COPD patients) 2 2\n• Relief pressure should be at 45-60 cm H O 2\nNOTE:\nParamedics may utilize an ATV following the initiation of the respiratory component of HQCPR at least 8 minutes after the start of resuscitation even if ROSC has occurred Reference: AHA/ILCOR released October 21, 2025",

Additional doses of above medications, if prescribed to patient or authorized, and if maximum dose has not been administered.\n\nMild distress in children is indicated by a slight increase in work of breathing while maintaining good air exchange, with no evidence of cyanosis, change in mental status, and no intercostal retractions. Severe distress in children is evidenced by poor air entry, extreme use of accessory muscles, nasal flaring, grunting, cyanosis and/or altered mental status (weak cry, somnolence, irritability, poor responsiveness). REMEMBER: Severe bronchospasm may present without wheezes, if there is minimal air movement. Respiratory Distress is defined as inadequate breathing in terms of rate, rhythm, quality and/or depth of breathing. Children who are breathing too fast or slow, or in an abnormal pattern or manner, may not be receiving enough oxygen to support bodily functions and may allow an increase in carbon dioxide to dangerous levels.

    "content": "EMT STANDING ORDERS\n 1.0 Routine Patient Care For a newly born not in distress, treat according to Protocol 2.11 Newly Born Care. For the premature newly born patient, consider using additional warming techniques such as a swaddling system included in the obstetrical kit, wrap the baby in a dry blanket, apply a head covering, and turn the heat up in the ambulance, to retain body temperature. If the mouth or nose is obstructed or heavy secretions are present, suction the oropharynx, then nares using a bulb syringe (or if necessary mechanical suction with a soft catheter at the lowest pressure that effectively removes the secretions, not to exceed 100 mm Hg.) Suction the hypopharynx only if the newly born is not vigorous (e.g. poor muscle tone, weak respiratory effort, heart rate < 100 beats per minute.) Request ALS immediately for further assessment of possible need for advanced airway management.\nIf ventilations are inadequate, if the chest fails to rise, or the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, initiate positive pressure bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilations at a rate of 40-60 breaths per minute. Resuscitation should be initiated with room air. Inflation pressures of the BVM should be individualized to achieve an increase in heart rate and adequate chest rise with each breath. Be aware that BVMs with pop-off valves may deliver inconsistent results. Apply pulse oximetry monitoring; (preferably to the right hand.) Targeted pulse oximetry readings should be: 1 minute: 60-65% 2 minutes: 65-70% 3 minutes: 70-75% 4 minutes: 75-80% 5 minutes: 80-85% 10 minutes: 85-95% After 30 seconds of ventilations, auscultate apical heart beat with a stethoscope, and/or palpate the pulse e.g. by lightly grasping the base of the umbilical cord. For heart rates < 60 beats per minute after attempts to correct ventilations: Initiate CPR at a 3:1 ratio (for a range of 90 compressions/minute and 30 ventilations/ minute.) Minimize interruptions. Reassess every 60 seconds; if not improving continue CPR with 100% supplemental oxygen until recovery of a normal heart rate, then resume room air. If the heart rate is > 100 beats per minute but breathing is labored or there is persistent cyanosis and hypoxia: Position and clear airway. Continue to monitor SpO2. Provide supplemental oxygen as needed.\nNOTE: The newly born should be evaluated for central cyanosis. Peripheral cyanosis is common and may not be a reflection of inadequate oxygenation. If central cyanosis is present in a breathing newly born during stabilization, early administration of 100% oxygen is important while the newly born is being assessed for need of additional resuscitative measures.\nADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS\nConsider inserting a supraglottic airway (SGA) for newly borns ≥ 34 weeks gestation if positioning and BVM fail to improve oxygenation and heart rate.\nEstablish an IV/IO. If hypovolemia is suspected, administer 10ml/kg bolus of normal saline over 5-10 minutes.\nPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS\nConsider endotracheal intubation (ETI) if BVM or SGA ventilation is inadequate or\nP chest compressions are indicated, using a properly sized endotracheal tube (ETT.)\nFor a newly born infant, born before 28 weeks gestation, consider using a 2.5 mm\nETT.\nApply waveform capnography and closely monitor the newly born’s heart rate.\nApply the cardiac monitor and manage dysrhythmias according to Protocols 3.0 Cardiac (pediatric.) If the heart rate fails to improve with adequate ventilations and chest compressions, administer epinephrine 0.01 – 0.03 mg/kg IV/IO (0.1 – 0.3 ml/kg of 0.1 mg/ml) IV/IO.\n• If glucose level is < 60 mg/dL, administer dextrose 10% 0.5 grams/kg IV/IO in accordance with Protocol 2.3P Altered Mental/Neurological Status/Diabetic Emergencies/Coma – Pediatric.\nMEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER:\nEpinephrine infusion - 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min IV/IO, administration by infusion pump ONLY, mixed based on your formulary/pump library\nNOTE: Paramedics should flush all medications administered intravenously with 0.5-1.0 ml of\n0.9% normal saline.\nNOTE: Use the pediatric reference tools to assist in determining the proper sized equipment such as ETT size and medication doses.",

If not, this procedure should be followed, leaving the needles in as described above and below.\n• The dialysis machine will be left at the home.\n• If you can, note or photograph any clinically relevant values on the machine’s readouts, such as liters removed.\n• For a patient with an AV shunt, the result of this procedure is that the patient still has the dialysis needles in their AV fistula, ATTACHED to CLAMPED tubing, which is wrapped with gauze to keep the needles and tubing next to the patient’s arm (unless HD shunt clamps are used). Procedure: 1. Push the STOP button on the front of the machine and unplug the machine’s power cord. 2. Identify and close the 4 clamps on the tubing. If clamps are not on the tubing, use Kelly clamps or plastic clamps (which will usually be on or near the dialysis machine) to clamp off the 2 tubes both above and below the Luer lock disconnects.

These medications are often used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan) which is also used for pulmonary hypertension.\n• Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior-wall STEMI or suspected right ventricular (RV) involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload. caidraC Acute Coronary Syndrome - Adult If patient appears to be having a ST-elevation MI (STEMI), refer to the appropriate STEMI-Point of Entry (POE) plan, and transport accordingly. Avoid hyperoxygenation, oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition, and administered with evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO <90%, especially in 2 the presence of a suspected CVA/TIA or ACS. Additional signs and symptoms of an ACS patient may be; Sudden onset of diaphoresis (cool, clammy, wet skin often profuse), anxiety, restlessness, abnormal vital signs such as an irregular pulse rate, and nausea / vomiting. All ACS patients must be carefully monitored until a definitive diagnosis can be made at the hospital and shall have a 12-lead evaluation done by EMT-Paramedics. All patients with ACS- like symptoms of a non-traumatic etiology should be considered to be of cardiac origin, regardless of the 12-lead ECG interpretation, until proven otherwise. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) represents a spectrum of disease. There are at least three conditions identified within the spectrum of ACS: Classic anginal chest pain; atypical chest pain; anginal equivalents; Patients experiencing a myocardial infarction or an ischemic event of unknown etiology may, based on 12-lead interpretation fall into one of three categories, “injury (STEMI)” or “Ischemia” or “Non-Diagnostic.” Classical Anginal Chest Pain Atypical Chest Pain Anginal Equivalents Central Anterior Pain Epigastric discomfort Dyspnea Chest Pressure, tightness Musculoskeletal Syncope Crushing Pain Often Unilateral “Generally Weak” Pain radiating to arms, neck and back Nausea/Vomiting Palpitations caidraC Acute Coronary Syndrome – Adult Fibrinolytic Checklist\nNOTE: This checklist is intended only as a tool for the pre-hospital identification of patients with significant contraindication(s) to the administration of fibrinolytics in the acute ST elevation M.I.

    "content": "Soft Tissue/Crush Injuries/Crush Syndrome/Compartment Syndrome - Adult & Pediatric 4.7 Clinical Notes: Soft Tissue Injury is an injury to the soft parts of the musculoskeletal system, including muscles,tendons,ligaments, and other connective tissues. Treatment focuses on controlling bleeding, preventing further injury, and reducing contamination. Crush Injury is a hypoperfusion injury and is associated with severe trauma. It most commonly occurs in multiple casualty incidents (MCI), such as bombings, earthquakes, building collapse, train accidents and mining accidents. It is the result of compression or pressure on various parts of or all of the human body. Crush Syndrome is a reperfusion injury and may result in fatal injury or severe metabolic abnormalities that may result in death. Careful monitoring of these patients is essential. Compartment Syndrome is usually due to a crush injury and is a surgical emergency. It occurs most commonly in the forearm, leg, gluteal region, thigh, and lumbar paraspinous muscles. Compartment syndrome may result in ischemic swelling, muscle infarction, nerve injury and permanent loss of extremity function. Monitor closely for the development of compartment syndrome (characterized by pain out of proportion to clinical exam, tense swelling, pain with passive stretch, muscle weakness, absent pulses in the extremity, paresthesia.)\nEMT STANDING ORDERS\n1.0 Routine Patient Care If there is any concern for the patient having an unstable airway and/or inadequate breathing, extricate the patient immediately to a safe area for immediate treatment. Control and stop any identified life-threatening hemorrhage (tourniquet, direct pressure, wound packing, etc.). If wound is grossly contaminated, irrigate with sterile water or normal saline\n•\nStabilize all protruding foreign bodies (impaled objects) if noted Place dry sterile dressing on all open wounds and bandage as needed. Closely monitor patients circulation, sensory, and motor function (CSM) continuously. For patients with < 2 hours of entrapment, consider possible crush injury. The key to treatment is comprehensive therapy, including thorough and rapid reduction in tension of the affected area.

    "content": "Low Titer Type O+ Whole Blood (LTOWB) or Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) Transfusion\nPURPOSE:\nBlood is a very rare and valuable resource with limited but critical indications for field use.\nAs such, use of this protocol will require a level of oversight not typical of other medical director option (MDO) protocols. Unlike other MDO protocols, implementation of this requires a specific letter of approval Services (Department). Assessment of a proposed program for approval will include, but not be limited to, assessments of blood bank participation, storage protocols, training content and availability as a regional resource. Request for a letter of approval must be made by email to the OEMS Clinical Coordinator (Renee Atherton, NRP, at Renee.Atherton@mass.gov). Additionally, questions and further questions must also be sent to the Clinical Coordinator, at Renee.Atherton@mass.gov. This protocol is intended for use in blunt and penetrating trauma. Other causes of hemorrhage may be amenable to treatment with blood products and protocols will be developed for them in the future. Under Statewide Treatment Protocol 1.0 Routine Patient Care the “Exception Principle” is available for variances. Criteria for Participation Low Titer Type O+ Whole Blood (LTOWB) or Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) Transfusion Purpose: The intent of this protocol is to deliver blood in the field as a regional resource to trauma patients that show signs and symptoms of shock from significant blood loss. Inclusion Criteria: Patients with blunt or penetrating trauma with ongoing or suspected ongoing major hemorrhage based on their presenting injury or diagnosis and with clinical signs of shock. Clinical Criteria: Significant hemorrhage due to trauma AND one of the following; SBP </= 70 mmHg or SBP </= 90 mmHg and heart rate >/=110 or Traumatic arrest witnessed by EMS, OR\nA shock index of > 0.9\nConsiderations:\nWhen possible obtain informed verbal consent for blood transfusion prior to initiation of the infusion. In many cases, due to nature of the trauma, blood transfusion will be initiated based on implied consent in the emergency setting. All documentation and blood supplies used (tubing, bag, etc.) from the blood given must stay with the patient and be transferred to the receiving hospital staff on patient turnover. Contraindications: Patient or parent/legal guardian refusal of blood transfusion for religious, social or cultural reasons must be documented accordingly. Obtain the appropriate patient or parent/legal guardian signatures when possible. Hypotension or hemodynamic instability solely due to EMS-administered medications (i.e. opioids) does NOT meet criteria for transfusion.\nPARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS\n• 1.0 Routine Patient Care\n• Make sufficient attempts to first control obvious hemorrhage\n• Assess the patient for inclusion criteria\n• Establish at least 1, and when possible, 2 large bore IV’s.

Blood should be administered through the largest gauge IV possible.\n• Prime blood tubing and blood warmer unit with normal saline (DO NOT use lactated ringers or D5W.) Spike one unit of LTOWB or PRBC to “y” connector on primed blood tubing and blood warmer.\n• Administer 1 Unit of LTOWB or PRBC at a wide open rate with a pressure bag. Once the blood is infused, flush line with normal saline to a maximum of 250ml.\n• Recheck Vital signs every 5-minutes at a minimum\n• If patient continues to meet criteria for transfusion after first unit, may transfuse a second unit.\n• Consider 1 Gram of Calcium Gluconate IV or equivalent dose of Calcium Chloride IV for every 1-2 Units of blood transfused\n• If not already administered, administer TXA.\nLow Titer Type O+ Whole Blood (LTOWB) or Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) Transfusion\n• For patients younger than 15 years of age, who show signs of absent radial pulses, clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock, or traumatic arrest witnessed by EMS.\n• SBP </= 70 + 2 times (age in years) mmHg or\n• Heart rate >/= age appropriate indication for shock in proper setting.\n• Pediatric patients should have a blood administration through the largest gauge IV with which it is possible to obtain access in the patient. IO access may be considered if IV access is unobtainable.\n• Administer 10ml/kg of LTOWB or PRBC to a max dose of 1 Unit. If patient continues to meet criteria for transfusion after first dose, may administer a second dose of 10ml/kg. Medical Control May Order\n• For pediatric patients, consult medical control for additional doses, if indicated.\n• Consult medical control for all patients of any age you have questions about for appropriateness and dosing, particularly patients younger than 15 years of age.

    "title": "Air Medical Transport",
    "content": "& Introduction: The use of air medical services has become the standard of care for many critically ill or injured patients who require transport to specialized medical facilities in accordance with Department-approved Statewide Point - of-Entry (POE) plans such as Trauma, Stroke, and STEMI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, or PCI) centers. This protocol has been establish so that air medical support does not require Medical Control approval. However, contacting Medical Control should be considered whenever appropriate and must be contacted when the protocol requires it. The following constitutes the philosophical foundation for calling for air medical transport. Patients in cardiac arrest subsequent to blunt trauma, in general, should not be transported by air ambulance. In the event of cardiac arrest after the request for air ambulance, the air medical crew may be utilized for resuscitation and transport either by ground or air. Patients in cardiac arrest subsequent to penetrating truncal or extremity trauma MAY be appropriate for transport by air ambulance if ETA for responding aircraft is less than ground transport time to closest facility. Patients with an uncontrolled or compromised airway should be brought to the nearest appropriate facility unless advanced life support (ALS) service (by ground or air) can intercept in a timelier fashion. EMS personnel should consider requesting ground advanced life support (ALS) and air medical support when both the operational and patient conditions listed below exist: Operational Conditions: In general, the patient should begin movement toward the appropriate receiving facility as soon as practical. Consider landing zones located along the route of travel to minimize total field time. Air Medical transport should be considered when: Ground transport time to the closest appropriate POE hospital exceeds the ETA of air medical, OR Patient location, weather, or road conditions preclude the use of ground ambulance, OR Prolonged scene patient management due to entrapment/extrication challenges, OR Multiple patients are present that will exceed the capabilities of local hospital and agencies Patient Conditions 1. Physiologic Criteria: a. Unstable Vital Signs 2. Anatomic Injury: a. Evidence of Spinal Cord injury including paralysis or paresthesia. b. Severe Blunt Trauma: Head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale of twelve [12] or less) Severe chest or abdominal injury Severe pelvic injury excluding simple hip fractures. c. Two or more proximal long-bone fractures d. Burns: Greater than 20% Body Surface Area (BSA) second or third degree burns; Evidence of airway or facial burns; Circumferential extremity burns; or Burns associated with trauma. e. Penetrating injuries of head, neck, chest, abdomen or groin. f. Amputation of extremities, excluding digits. 3. Cardiac Conditions a. ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) b. Persistent ventricular tachycardia (unstable) 4. Stroke a. Concern for large vessel occlusion (by FAST-ED) within 24-hours last known well b. Pediatric patients c. Pregnancy & Air Medical Transport 7.1 Protocol Continued Special Conditions: The following should be considered in deciding whether to request air medical transport, for traumatically injured patients, but are not automatic or absolute criteria: 1. Mechanism of Injury a. Motor Vehicle Crash: Patient ejected from vehicle. Death in same passenger compartment. b. Pedestrian struck by a vehicle and thrown more than 15 feet, or run over by a vehicle. 2. Significant Medical History a. Age < 8 or ˃ 55 years of age. b. Significant coexistent illness (such as anticoagulation). c. Pregnancy.",

    "content": "Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) and Comfort Care/Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order Verification & Introduction EMS personnel at all levels are required to provide emergency care and transport patients to appropriate health care facilities. EMS personnel are further required to provide treatment to the fullest extent possible, subject to their level of certification and the level of licensure of the ambulance service for which they are working. However, more and more patients, where it is medically appropriate, are opting for limitations on life-sustaining treatments, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), in the event of cardiac arrest. Thus, EMS personnel may encounter a patient who has chosen such options and has either a Massachusetts Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatments (MOLST) or the Comfort Care/DNR Order Verification Form or bracelet (CC/DNR). These documents provide for a statewide, standardized form, approved by (OEMS), that EMS personnel can instantly recognize as an actionable order (MOLST) or verification of such an order (CC/DNR) regarding the use of life sustaining treatments. This protocol governs EMS personnel response to a patient with a MOLST or CC/DNR form. Implementation Procedures 1. Confirm the identity of the individual with the MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification Form or bracelet; 2. Check validity: a. CC/DNR: To assure that a DNR order is recognized in any out-of-hospital setting, an attending physician, nurse practitioner, or authorized physician assistant, who is licensed in Massachusetts, must provide a patient who has a current DNR order, with a fully executed CC/DNR Order Verification form to verify the existence of a DNR order. To be valid, the CC/ DNR Order Verification Form shall contain: i. the patient’s name, and all other patient identifiers requested on the form; ii. date of issuance; iii. the signature and telephone number of an attending physician, nurse practitioner, or authorized physician assistant; iv. the signature and printed name of the patient, guardian or health care agent signing the form, with the following exception; and: v. a date of expiration, if any, of the underlying DNR order. If there is a date of expiration, and that date has passed, the CC/DNR is not valid. b. MOLST: Alternatively, to assure a patient with a desire to document decisions regarding DNR and/or other life-sustaining treatments (which includes CPR, intubation with ventilation, and non-invasive ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP) has those preferences honored, a Massachusetts-licensed attending physician, nurse practitioner or authorized physician assistant can provide a patient with a MOLST form. The MOLST form represents actual medical orders to EMS personnel related to a patient’s preferences for resuscitation, ventilation and hospitalization. To be valid, the MOLST form must contain: i. patient name and appropriate identifiers as requested on the form; ii. box D and E of the MOLST form must be fully completed for page 1 to be considered valid – which is all that is relevant for EMS personnel. The form must be signed by a patient, patient’s guardian, or activated health care agent. For a patient in a licensed health care facility only, this Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) and Comfort Care/Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order Verification requirement is met if the guardian or agent cannot sign the form, and the licensed health care facility provides an alternate signature indicating that the required conversation with the guardian or agent has occurred and the form reflects the patient’s wishes and goals of care as expressed to the clinician who signed Section E on the agent’s behalf. If a MOLST form is presented by the licensed health care facility with such signatures in box D, EMS can assume the form is valid; iii. A MOLST order that has an expiration date or revocation date that is in the past is not valid. c. Revocation: A MOLST order for DNR or CC/DNR form may state it has been revoked. If that is the case, the order or form is not valid. d. Health Care Agent with Documentation on Scene: If the patient’s activated health care agent is on scene with his/her health care proxy document in hand, the health care agent may change or revoke the patient’s MOLST form directions. EMS is not responsible to check the validity of the health care proxy document. If presented by a health care agent, they can assume it is valid. 3. Action of EMS if no valid CC/DNR or no valid MOLST that includes a DNR order: In accordance with standard EMS Statewide Treatment Protocols, EMS personnel will resuscitate patients without a valid CC/DNR Order Verification Form or without a MOLST that has documented a DNR order, as well as a patient who has a MOLST form indicating a preference FOR resuscitation. Remember, if there is any doubt about the current validity of a MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification form, EMS personnel are to resuscitate and provide care in accordance with the Statewide Treatment Protocols. 4. Patient Care for confirmed valid CC/DNR or MOLST with orders for DNR: a. If the patient is in full respiratory or cardiac arrest, the EMS personnel shall not resuscitate, which means: i. do not initiate CPR, ii. do not insert an oropharyngeal airway (OPA), iii. do not provide ventilatory assistance, iv. do not artificially ventilate the patient (e.g. mouth-to-mouth, bag valve mask), v. do not administer chest compressions, vi. do not initiate advanced airway measures, vii. do not administer cardiac resuscitation drugs, and viii. do not defibrillate. b. If the patient is not in full respiratory or cardiac arrest, but the patient’s heartbeat or breathing is inadequate, EMS personnel shall not resuscitate but shall provide, within the scope of their training and level of certification, full palliative care and transport, as appropriate, including: i. additional interventions a patient has indicated be given on the MOLST form, including intubation with ventilation or non-invasive ventilation such as CPAP. ii. emotional support; iii. suction airway; iv. administer oxygen; v. application of cardiac monitor; vi. control bleeding; vii. splint; viii. position for comfort; Protocol Continues & Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) and Comfort Care/Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order Verification & ix. initiate IV line; and, x. contact Medical Control, if appropriate for further orders, including necessary medications. c. If the patient is not in respiratory or cardiac arrest, and the patient’s heart beat and breathing are adequate, but there is some other emergency illness or injury, the EMS personnel shall provide full treatment and transport, as appropriate, within the scope of their training and level of certification. 5. Questions about the MOLST or CC/DNR: If EMS personnel have any questions regarding the applicability of the MOLST or CC/DNR form with regard to any specific individual, or a good-faith basis to doubt the continued validity of the MOLST or CC/DNR form, EMS personnel shall verify with the patient if the patient is able to respond. If the patient cannot respond, EMS personnel shall provide full treatment and transport, or contact Medical Control for further orders. In all cases, EMS personnel shall document the circumstances on the trip record. 6. Previously-initiated CPR: In the event of respiratory or cardiac arrest and resuscitative efforts are initiated prior to EMS confirmation of the valid DNR order on the MOLST form or a valid CC/ DNR Order Verification form, EMS shall discontinue the following measures: a) CPR; b) cardiac medications, and c) advanced airway measures. 7. Documentation: EMS personnel must document the existence and validity of the MOLST order or CC/DNR form on their patient care report (PCR). For a MOLST form, EMS personnel must specifically document on the PCR all clinical information on the MOLST form regarding the patient’s preferences for care. For both MOLST and CC/DNR Order Verification Form, EMS personnel must also document on the PCR all care they provided to the patient, including palliative measures. 8. Revocation on scene: The MOLST order with DNR or CC/DNR may be revoked by the patient at any time, regardless of mental or physical condition, by the destruction or affirmative revocation of the MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification, or by the patient’s direction that the MOLST or CC/ DNR Order Verification not be followed by EMS personnel or be destroyed. It may also be revoked by the patient’s activated health care agent who is on scene with his/her health care proxy document in hand. EMS personnel, upon witnessing or verifying a revocation, shall communicate that revocation in writing to the hospital to ensure its inclusion in the patient's medical record. EMS personnel shall also document the revocation on their PCR.",

    "content": "Pediatric Transport\nPATIENT TRANSPORT\nAmbulance services must have appropriately sized child restraint system(s) readily available on all ambulances that may transport children. Additionally, EMS personnel must be initially and recurrently evaluated and trained on the correct use of those restraint systems; 1. The device(s) must cover, at minimum, a weight range of between 5 and 99 pounds (2.3 - 45 kg), supporting the safest transport possible for all persons of any age or size. Massachusetts statute (specifically) requires that all children under the age of 8 traveling in a motor vehicle must be secured in a child passenger restraint (aka car seat), unless they are 57 inches or taller, in which case, they need to be using a seat belt. An ill or injured patient who is a child must be restrained in a manner that minimizes injury in an ambulance crash. The best location for transporting a pediatric patient is on the ambulance cot. The method of restraint will be determined by various circumstances including the child’s medical condition and weight.\nANY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PROTOCOL REQUIRE REAL-TIME MEDICAL CONTROL\nORDERS. Note that exceptions to this protocol will likely result in substantially increased injury risk to the transported child, and Medical Control input will be needed to balance the risks against the risks of delay in transport.\nA patient who is a child must be transported with 5-point harness in a device designed for such a purpose. Attach device securely to cot utilizing upper back strap behind cot and lower straps around cot’s frame, or as per manufacturer’s instructions. 5-point harness must rest snugly against child Adjust head portion of cot according to manufacturer’s recommendation If no other vehicle is available and circumstances dictate that the ambulance must transport a well child, he/she may be transported in the following ways: Children who require a car seat or booster seat should be secured to the airway seat/ captain’s chair in the patient compartment using a size appropriate integrated seat or a convertible safety seat that is secured safely in relationship to the orientation of the captain’s chair. All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear facing seat until the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat manufacturer. Every effort should be made to properly secure the car seat according to manufacturer’s instructions. Passenger seat of the driver’s compartment if child is large enough (according to manufacturer’s guidelines) to ride forward-facing in a child safety seat or booster seat. Airbag should be turned off. If the airbag can be deactivated, an infant, restrained in a rear-facing infant seat, may be placed in the passenger seat of the driver’s compartment. & Infants under 2.3 kilograms who also require temperature regulation should be transported in a transport isolette that has been designed for EMS use.\nNON-PATIENT TRANSPORT\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Best practice is to transport well children in a vehicle other than the ambulance, whenever possible, for safety. Examples of acceptable transport in another vehicle would be by police cruiser without a prisoner partition and only in the back seat, a family member’s personal car, or another response vehicle, only in the back seat. & Pediatric Transport 7.4\nMOTHER AND NEWLY-BORN TRANSPORT\nTransport the newly-born in an approved size-appropriate child restraint system that complies with the injury criteria of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213 in the rear-facing EMS provider seat/captain’s chair that prevents both lateral and forward movement, leaving the cot for the mother. Use a convertible seat with a forward- facing belt path. DO NOT use a rear-facing-only seat in the rear-facing EMS provider’s seat. You may also use an integrated child restraint system certified by the manufacturer to meet the injury criteria of FMVSS No. 213.\nUSE OF PATIENT’S CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY SEAT AFTER INVOLVEMENT IN\nMOTOR VEHICLE CRASH\nThe pediatric patient’s safety seat may be used to transport the child to the hospital after involvement in a minor crash if ALL of the following apply: It is a convertible seat with both front and rear belt paths. Visual inspection, including under movable seat padding, does not reveal cracks or deformation. Vehicle in which safety seat was installed was capable of being driven from the scene of the crash. Vehicle door nearest the child safety seat was undamaged. The air bags (if any) did not deploy.",

    "title": "Refusal of Medical Care and Transportation",
    "content": "& Refusal of Medical Care and Ambulance Transport\nPURPOSE:\nEstablish guidelines for the management and documentation of situations where patients refuse treatment or transportation. Under the Commonwealth’s EMS System regulations, at 105 CMR170.355 (A) “Responsibility to Dispatch, Treat and Transport,” ambulance services and their agents may not refuse any of these responsibilities, absent a documented patient refusal. Ambulance services and their EMS personnel must be extremely cautious about accepting patient refusals. Refusal of care There are three components to a valid refusal of care. Absence of any of these components will most likely result in an invalid refusal. The three components are as follows: 1. Competence: In general, a patient who is an adult or a legally emancipated minor * is considered legally competent to refuse care. A parent or legal guardian who is on-scene may refuse care on his or her minor children’s behalf. EMS shall not accept a refusal of treatment for a minor patient via phone. 2. Capacity: In order to refuse medical assistance a patient must have the capacity to understand the nature of his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment, and the risks associated with refusal of care. A health care agent who is named in a health care proxy document for the patient may refuse care on behalf of the patient only if 1) he or she is on-scene and 2) he or she has his/her health care proxy document in hand to show EMS. If the patient objects to the health care agent’s decision, there is no effective refusal. If there is any doubt about the health care agent’s authority, EMS is to transport the patient 3. Informed Refusal: A patient must be fully informed about his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment and the risks associated with refusing care. Patients who meet criteria in this Protocol shall be allowed to make decisions regarding their medical care, including refusal of evaluation, treatment, or transport. These criteria include: 1. Initiated solely by the patient, not suggested/prompted by the EMTs. 2. Adults (≥ 18 years of age) and legally emancipated minors* 3. Orientation to person, place, time, and situation. 4. No evidence of altered level of consciousness resulting from head trauma, medical illness, intoxication, dementia, psychiatric illness or other causes. 5. No evidence of impaired judgment from alcohol or drug influence. 6. No language communication barriers. Reliable translation available (e.g., on scene interpreter, language line). 7. No evidence or admission of suicidal ideation resulting in any gesture or attempt at self-harm. No verbal or written expression of suicidal ideation regardless of any apparent inability to complete a suicide. Definitions Minor: A person under the age of 18, who is not an emancipated minor (see below). Emancipated Minor: For the purpose of making decisions regarding medical care and treatment, an emancipated minor is a person under the age of 18 who is 1. married, widowed or divorced; 2. the parent of a child; 3. a member of the armed forces; 4. pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; or 5. living separate and apart from a parent/legal guardian and is managing his or her own financial affairs. & Refusal of Medical Care and Ambulance Transport EMS providers will make every reasonable effort to convince reluctant patients to access medical care at the emergency department via the EMS system before accepting a refusal of medical care and ambulance transport. Contact Medical Control for all patients who present a threat to themselves, present with an altered level of consciousness or diminished mental capacity, or have history or examination findings consistent with a high-risk refusal. The physician is to be provided all relevant information and may need to speak directly with the patient by radio or preferably a recorded landline. Although a minor cannot legally consent to medical treatment, consent is legally implied in an emergency. In assessing whether there is an emergency, particularly with regard to motor vehicle crashes, EMTs must include the mechanism of injury in their analysis. Procedure 1. Perform an assessment of the patient’s medical/traumatic condition, and, to the extent permitted by the patient, a physical exam including vital signs. Your assessment, or the patient’s refusal of assessment, must be fully documented in the trip record. 2. Explain to the patient the nature and severity of his/her illness or injury, the treatments being proposed, the risks and consequences of accepting or refusing treatment, and the potential alternatives. Fully document the explanation given to the patient in your trip report. 3. Prepare and explain the refusal of medical care and ambulance transport document. 4. Documentation of refusal of medical care and ambulance transport must be signed by the patient (or, in the case of a minor patient, by the minor patient’s parent, legal guardian, or authorized representative) at the time of the refusal. Documentation should include, when possible, a signature by a witness, preferably a competent relative, friend, police officer, or impartial third person. 5. The fact that the patient refused medical care and transport must be documented in the trip record, and the signed refusal of medical care and ambulance transport document must be included as part of the trip record. 6. If Medical Control was consulted for a refusal of care, obtain and document the physician’s name in the patient care report.",

    "content": "& Withholding and Cessation of Resuscitation 7.7 Purpose: 1) To clarify for EMS services and their EMTs when resuscitative measures may be withheld for patients in cardiac arrest and 2) to define when EMTs can cease resuscitative measures already initiated. Background and EMS Services’ Training/Support Services Obligations: Emergency Medical Technicians must begin or continue resuscitative measures for all patients in cardiac arrest except as indicated in this Protocol (also issued as Administrative Requirement (A/R) 5- 515). If in doubt, begin resuscitative efforts. All EMS services must provide appropriate training on management of death in the field, including legal, procedural, and psychological aspects; and access to support services. EMS services and EMS personnel should be aware that the nursing staff of a health care facility, such as a skilled nursing facility, may need a physician order (including a medical control physician’s order, if allowed by nursing home policy) to halt resuscitation attempts, even in the case of patients meeting EMS “obvious death” criteria, as set out below. Nursing staff and EMS personnel should come to a cooperative decision on continuation or termination of resuscitation; this process may include obtaining physician input and orders. If the medical professionals at the bedside are unable to reach agreement on attempting or terminating efforts, the presumption should be to continue resuscitative efforts and transport the patient to an emergency department. I. Exceptions to Initiation of Resuscitation Other than in overriding circumstances such as a large mass-casualty incident or a hazardous scene, the following are the only exceptions to initiating and maintaining resuscitative measures in the field: 1. Current, valid DNR, verified per this protocol. 2. Health care agent who is named in a health care proxy document for the patient requests no resuscitative efforts on behalf of the patient, but only if a. he or she is on scene and b. he or she has his/her health care proxy document in hand to show EMS. If there is any doubt about the health care agent’s authority, and none of the other exceptions to initiation of resuscitation are present, EMS is to resuscitate the patient. 3. Trauma inconsistent with survival a. Decapitation: severing of the vital structures of the head from the remainder of the patient’s body b. Transection of the torso: body is completely cut across below the shoulders and above the hips c. Evident complete destruction of brain or heart d. Incineration of the body e. Cardiac arrest (i.e. pulselessness) documented at first EMS evaluation when such condition is the result of significant blunt or penetrating trauma and the arrest is obviously and unequivocally due to such trauma, EXCEPT in the specific case of arrest due to penetrating chest trauma and short transport time to definitive care (in which circumstance, resuscitate and transport). 4. Body condition clearly indicating biological death. a. Complete decomposition or putrefaction: the skin surface (not only in isolated areas) is bloated or ruptured, with sloughing of soft tissue, and the odor of decaying flesh. b. Dependent lividity and/or rigor: when the patient’s body is appropriately examined, there is a clear demarcation of pooled blood within the body, and/or major joints (jaw, shoulders, elbows, hips, or knees) are immovable. 7 . 7 Withholding and Cessation of Resuscitation Procedure for Lividity and/or Rigor Mortis: All of the criteria below must be established and documented in addition to lividity and/or rigor in order to withhold resuscitation: Exceptions to Initiation of Resuscitation, Continued i. Respirations are absent for at least 30 seconds; and ii. Carotid pulse is absent for at least 30 seconds; and iii. Lung sounds auscultated by stethoscope bilaterally are absent for at least 30 seconds; and iv. Both pupils, if assessable, are non-reactive to light. II. Cessation of Resuscitation by EMTs Emergency Medical Technicians must continue resuscitative measures for all patients in cardiac arrest unless contraindicated by one of the exceptions below. 1. EMTs at all levels of certification may cease resuscitative efforts at any time when any “Exception to Initiation of Resuscitation” as defined in I., above, is determined to be present. 2. Paramedics only may cease resuscitative efforts, if properly training and authorized by your AHMD as per Protocol 6.4 Withholding and Cessation of Resuscitation by\nEMT Paramedic as a Medical Control Option.\nSpecial Considerations and Procedures:\n1 a. If during transport, EMTs cease resuscitation of a patient in accordance with the requirements above, they shall continue to the closest appropriate hospital for pronouncement of death. This is always a special circumstance that is in the interest of public health and safety, and thus meets the requirements of 105 CMR 170.365. 1 b. During transports when resuscitative efforts have appropriately been ceased in accordance with the requirements above, EMTs must cover the person with a sheet, transport without the use of emergency vehicle audible and visual warning devices, and notify the receiving hospital in advance. 2. In all cases where EMTs have withheld or ceased resuscitative efforts in accordance with the requirements above, and left the person in the field, procedures must include notification of appropriate medical or medico-legal authorities, such as police. 3. EMS patient care report documentation must reflect the criteria used to determine obvious death or allow cessation of resuscitative efforts.",

    "content": "& Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) 7.8\nEMT/ADVANCED EMT/ PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS\nPURPOSE:\nTo provide an overview of how a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) works and how EMS provider assessment and treatment differs for a patient with a VAD. Highlights of Assessing and Treating an VAD patient Recognize that you have a patient with a VAD Determine if your patient has a VAD problem, or an unrelated illness or injury\nA completely stable patient may have no palpable pulse or measurable blood pressure\nMental status and skin color must be used to determine patient stability CPR should almost never be performed on a VAD patient Patients with a VAD should almost never be pronounced dead at the scene Overview of an VAD\nThe VAD is a mechanical device that takes over some or all of the pumping function of the heart’s left ventricle. This device is used for patients of any age or gender with advanced heart failure who would not otherwise survive without this device. Heart failure can result from chronic/long-term hypertension and heart disease, congenital heart defects, / mechanical damage to the heart, infection, postpartum complications and many other reasons.\nSome VAD patients will have an VAD while they are waiting for a heart transplant (called Bridge-to-Transplant). Other VAD patients, who are not eligible for a heart transplant for some reason, will live with the device for the rest of their lives (called Destination Therapy, / or Lifetime use). How the Heart Works versus How VAD works The normal pumping function of the heart is achieved by the contraction of the left ventricular muscle, which pushes a bolus of blood forward in the cardiovascular system with each contraction. This contraction is what we feel when checking a pulse, and what we hear when taking a blood pressure. If the heart is not contracting, blood is not moving forward in the system, and we don’t feel or hear a pulse. The VAD, in contrast, flows constantly and therefore creates no “pulse” to feel or hear. The VAD is a tube that is about ½ -1 inch in diameter with a pump in the middle. One end of the tube (inflow) is surgically inserted into the left ventricle, and the other end (outflow) is sewn into the aorta, just above where it exits the heart. The pump on the VAD spins constantly. The right side of the heart still pushes blood through the lungs and back to the left ventricle, but then the VAD pump pulls the blood out of the left ventricle and pumps it out to the body, taking over most or all of the failed pumping action of the left ventricle. The drive unit for the pump, which includes the power source and programming controls, is outside of the body and connects to the VAD by a cord that exits the body through the abdomen, usually in the right upper quadrant.\nNOTE: The important part to us as EMS providers is that the pump is a constant flow pump.\nThere is no rhythmic pumping as there is with the ventricle, and therefore there is little to no pulse. This means you can have a perfectly stable and healthy looking person who has no palpable pulse and whom you may or may not be able to take a blood pressure. Policy Continues & Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) 7.8 Assessing the VAD Patient 1. RECOGNIZE you have a VAD patient. The VAD patient has a control unit attached to their waist, or in a shoulder bag. The control unit is attached to a power cord exiting from the patients’ abdomen. The control unit will be attached to batteries mounted to the belt, in shoulder holsters, or in a shoulder bag. At home, it could be attached to a long cord that connects to a large power unit. 2. DECIDE if you have a patient with an VAD problem, or a patient with a medical problem who just happens to have an VAD. Patients with VADS will have all the same illnesses and injuries as any other patient you see. Their VAD may have nothing to do with the reason you were called.\n3. LOOK:\nAlarms on the control unit will most likely indicate an VAD problem. Follow resource guides with the patient to trouble shoot. Skin color and mental status are the most reliable indicators of patient stability for the VAD patient. /\n4. LISTEN:\nListen over the VAD pump location to make sure you can hear it running. This will\nA be just to the left of the epigastrium, immediately below the base of the heart.\nYou should hear a low hum with a stethoscope if the pump is running. Don’t / assume the pump is running just because the control unit looks OK. The patient and their family are experts on this device. Listen to what they have to say about any problems with the VAD.\n5. FEEL:\nFeel the control unit. A hot control unit indicates the pump is working harder than it should and often indicates a pump problem such as a thrombosis (clot) in the pump. The use of pulse and blood pressure to assess stability can be unreliable in an VAD patient, even if they are very stable.\n6. VITALS:\nPulse: generally, you will be unable to feel a pulse.\nBlood Pressure: you may or may not be able to obtain one, standard readings are unreliable and may vary from attempt to attempt. If NIBP machine can detect a blood pressure, adjust it to display Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). This is a more reliable measure of perfusion and the calculation for MAP can overcome variations in standard readings. A MAP of 60-70 is normal. Pulse-oximetry: readings seem to be fairly accurate and consistent, according to data, despite the manufacturer stating that pulse oximetry often doesn’t work. Quantitative Continuous Waveform Capnography: This should remain accurate, as it relies on respiration, not pulse. Normal (printed) waveform shape with a normal respiratory rate and low CO readings (<30) can indicate low perfusion = 2 poor pump function. Temperature: infection and sepsis are common, check temperatures.

    "content": "Multiple Casualty Incidents (MCI Triage) selpicnirP dna\nEMT, Advanced EMT and Paramedic MCI Procedure Summary:\nAll EMT level personnel will eventually be involved in the management of an MCI. It is imperative that all EMTs implement the below incident command system (ICS) in all MCI situations. Every\nEMT must be aware and have a thorough knowledge of their particular role and responsibilities in the rescue effort. Due to the many complexities of MCI/Disaster situations, it is recommended that all EMTs should participate and receive additional training in MCI/Disaster management. Scene Management: Each MCI/Disaster scene presents its own unique hazards and difficulties. This plan is a general guide to the management of MCIs. It should be understood that modifications may need to be made by command personnel on scene as such changes are needed. When the Statewide MCI plan is officially in place, nothing in this protocol shall be intended to replace or supersede the statewide plan.\nA multiple casualty incident (MCI) is any situation where the number of sick or injured patients exceeds the available local, regional or state EMS system resources to provide adequate care in a timely manner to minimize injury and death. An MCI may be the result of a man made disaster or a natural event. Successful management of an MCI will require preplanning and organization of local, regional and state EMS, fire, law enforcement and emergency management resources. CMED, hospital resources and specialized care services must also be included in preparing the MCI plan. MCI management process is defined in the Incident Command System (ICS). In general, the Fire Department or Emergency Medical Service Agency having jurisdictional authority establishes the overall command and designates the incident commander (IC) at an MCI scene.\nNOTE: Other agencies may function as the IC, for example, Law Enforcement agencies at a crime scene or hostage situation. Other agencies may assist the IC. Clear precise inter- agency communication networks must be established for successful MCI management. MCIs within the Commonwealth assessed by EMS will be classified by levels. Response to an MCI is based on the number of potential victims generated by the incident. The following levels indicate the number of potential MCI casualties, should regional EMS providers require a mutual aid response: Level 1: 1-10 potential victims Level 2: 11-30 potential victims Level 3: 31-50 potential victims Level 4: 51-200 potential victims Level 5: Greater than 200 victims Level 6: Long-Term Operational period(s) Multiple Casualty Incidents (MCI Triage) selpicnirP dna Triage: Triage is a special process of sorting patients by the severity of injury or illness to determine the need of emergency care and transportation. This needs to be a continuous process throughout the management of an MCI. The initial triage process should be performed by the first crew to arrive on scene and needs to be continuously reevaluated since the patient's triage status may change. Presently there are no national standard guidelines established for triage. Massachusetts services in general will be using a form of the SMART TAG system, while New England services in general use START triage and compatible tagging methods. MCI triage and treatment priorities are generally defined as: Zero priority (BLACK TAG): Deceased or live patients with obvious fatal, non- resuscitatable injuries First priority (RED TAG ): Severely injured patients requiring immediate care and transport. (e.g., respiratory distress, thoracoabdominal injury, severe head or maxillofacial injuries, shock/severe bleeding, severe burns) Second priority (YELLOW TAG): Patients with injuries that are determined not to be immediately life threatening. (e.g., abdominal injury without shock, thoracic injury without respiratory compromise, major fractures without shock, head injury/cervical spine injury, and minor burns) Third priority (GREEN TAG): Patients with minor injuries that do not require immediate stabilization. (e.g., soft tissue injuries, extremity fractures and dislocations, maxillofacial injuries Scene Assessment and Triage Priorities: 1. Maintain universal blood and body fluid precautions. 2. The initial response team should assess the scene for potential hazards, safety and number of victims to determine the appropriate level of response. 3. Notify agency dispatch to declare an MCI and need for interagency support as defined by incident level. Agency dispatch should coordinate request for additional resources and contact local mutual aid, regional and state level agencies for assistance and notification as needed. 4. Identify and designate the following positions as qualified personnel become available: EMS Command responsible for overall command of all EMS resources and tactics; Triage Officer responsible for overseeing all triage group activities; Treatment Officer responsible for overseeing all treatment group activities; Staging Officer responsible for overseeing staging of all arriving ambulances and other mobile EMS resources; Loading Officer responsible for overseeing loading of all treated patients into ambulances, buses and helicopters and logging patient info, tag numbers and coordinating hospital destinations with CMED. 5. Identify and designate EMS sector areas of MCI including Triage, Treatment, Staging, and Loading. 6. Post incident MCI Plan.",

DO NOT PROCEED beyond the staging area or the designated cold zone unless directed to do so by the incident commander, fire department officer in charge (OIC) or HazMat response team and only after donning proper personal protective equipment (PPE.) Prehospital teams, composed of fire and EMS first responders, are critical in ensuring the continuity of safe prehospital medical care of contaminated patients. Patients exposed to a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear hazard are considered contaminated until cleared by appropriate personnel. Patients encountered at HazMat incidents require emergency care with additional considerations and precautions for both the prehospital medical teams and receiving hospital. The on-scene goal is to ensure appropriate medical care of the contaminated patient while keeping all care teams and patients as safe as possible.\nA well-coordinated response is critical for patient care, scene safety and scene containment. Fire department and/or HazMat response teams will typically take command of incidents of this nature.\nHowever, EMS responders must maintain a strong situational awareness to maintain the safety of responders, the patients(s) and the receiving hospital. HazMat incidents are not always immediately identified or dispatched as such, and contaminated patients may self-transport to a hospital prior to EMS arrival. Early hospital notification by EMS is imperative to prepare to receive patients. Response Priorities: 1. Initiate the Incident Command System (ICS) and the Haz-Mat response plan per local protocols. In most cases the fire officer in charge (OIC) must activate the state wide Haz-Mat teams when deemed appropriate to do so. 2. Always position the ambulance uphill and upwind > 300ft from the incident. 3. Scene Assessment is a priority; Be alert for patients attempting to self-extricate from the scene. Failure to recognize this could rapidly expand the exposure area and decreases containment. 4. If appropriate to do so, declare the incident as a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI and follow Protocol 8.2 MCI. Scene Assessment and Triage Priorities: 1. The initial response team should assess the scene for potential hazards and number of victims to determine the appropriate level of response. 2. Notify C-Med and dispatch early of a HazMat alert indicating that the incident involves contaminated patients or potentially high threat patients who may have self extricated and self transported to local hospital emergency departments. C-Med will notify the local hospitals of the possible arrival of contaminated patients. 3. Identify the hazardous material(s) involved, including as much of the following information that can be obtain while maintaining the safety of all responders. Provide this information to C-Med as soon as it is possible to do so; a. Specific material name b. State the material is in (e.g., solid, liquid, gas) c. How much of the material has been released and if it is contained d. Identify the material using one of the resources listed * to determine the specific hazards, safe isolation distance, decontamination required and required PPE for responders. 4. Determine the number of patients and activate MCI protocols if indicated.\nNOTE: Exposure is when the patient is in the vicinity of a hazardous substance but does not have the hazardous substance on them of has ingested it. Contamination is defined as the patient has the hazardous substance on them or has ingested it. selpicnirP dna Hazardous Materials Response by EMS\nNOTE: * HazMat material identification – Obtain this information only when safe to do so.\n• Name and proper spelling of material, obtained from the official documentation such as the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), Bill of Lading, Waybill, or other documentation;\n• Emergency Response Guide ID #(4 digits) or Chemical Abstracts Substances (CAS) number;\n• Department of Transportation (DOT) classification on placard;\n• Bystanders , technicians, or employees at the incident location;\n• Physical description of the material such as color, and/or odor.\nEMT Basic, Advanced EMT and Paramedic Procedure Summary\nEMS is not typically first on a HazMat incident. However, encountering hazardous substances are becoming increasingly more frequent without prior identification on initial 9-1-1 calls by the call taker or dispatcher. EMTs at all levels of certification must maintain a high level of awareness when responding to all medical calls.

    "content": "selpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist is a paramedic (or higher medical provider) capable of delivering immediate medical response and support to urban search and rescue operations based on the FEMA National USAR Task Force medical team model. Paramedics operating under these protocols MUST have completed an approved FEMA (or equivalent) medical team training program, be a designated member of a recognized local, county or state USAR team and have the authority to function in this capacity from their agency’s AHMD. The primary mission of the medical team is to maintain the health and well-being of ALL team members during technical rescue operations. The secondary mission is to provide specialized medical care to injured victims. Overall, the role of the medical team is to act as the medical conscience for the team and to always act as an advocate for the patient. In most cases, a USAR team physician or AHMD will be on-scene to provide real time medical direction in accordance with these protocols. Medical Specialists follow the explicit orders of their agency’s affiliate hospital medical director (AHMD) or designee functioning under a comprehensive set of local policies and protocols based on nationally-accepted standards. Per regulations, any EMS personnel functioning at the ALS level of care must have a qualified and designated AHMD. These protocols are intended for use only by trained Medical Specialists specifically during USAR operations. Medical Specialists are not directly responsible for any person(s) outside the immediate\nP area of operations, whose care may safely be provided by the local EMS provider.\nOne of the primary functions of the Medical Specialist is to support the tactical operations by ensuring the health and safety of critical public safety personnel as well as any victims requiring specialty care inside the perimeter of high-risk, large-scale, and extended operations that otherwise cannot be attended to by conventional EMS providers. As such, the Medical Specialist may be asked to provide sick call care for predefined service members as directed by the AHMD in order to ensure they remain healthy and operationally capable. Any other person(s) or service members who present with an acute medical issue, should be considered patients under the definition of 105 CMR 170.020. Such care will be provided in accordance with the Statewide Treatment Protocols (STP). These protocols supplement the STPs and shall be used only by Medical Specialists. Once a victim is removed from the inner perimeter of operations, a transition of care will be made to the local ambulance service for continued patient care and transport. An exception may be made when a Medical Specialist’s training is needed to manage a specific illness/injury during transport. In this instance, a Medical Specialist should accompany the transporting EMS crew with the patient to the hospital and maintain any care and/or medications not covered by the STP(s). If during transport, the Medical Specialist encounters a significant conflict between these protocols and those of the transporting ambulance service, Medical Specialist should contact their AHMD and request a dual consult with the transporting ambulance service’s AHMD. If the Medical Specialist’s AHMD cannot be reached, standard online medical control consultation should be initiated.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist\nSTANDING/VERBAL MEDICAL ORDERS\nGiven the medical complexity of most victims of a USAR scenario, it is the expectation that all patient care activity during USAR operations have real-time medical direction established with a USAR team physician or AHMD as soon as feasibly possible. Any other on-scene\nEMT providing care at a special operations incident shall function in accordance with the STP and service-specific protocols.\nThese protocols are designed to provide supplemental guidance for patient care in the search and rescue environment. Unless otherwise specified, all medication doses have been presented in a weight-based format for use in both adult and pediatric patients. These guidelines represent the best practices drawn from current nationally accepted standards of care and evidence-based practice. Medicine is a constantly evolving practice and as such, guidelines cannot be developed for every possible clinical situation. These guidelines are NOT meant to replace good clinical judgment. Medical team members shall not act beyond their usual scope of practice (i.e. USAR or other service-specific protocols) unless trained or specifically approved to perform additional skills.\nTRAINING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE/IMPROVEMENT\nGiven the low frequency, high risk nature of these cases, it is presumed that ALL cases requiring the use of these protocols will undergo QA/QI review by the USAR team physician or AHMD. Any deviations from these protocols will be reviewed by the AHMD and reviewed with the agency’s medical team members. It is also the expectation that as part of competency maintenance and participation as a Medical Specialist, a comprehensive training program by the AHMD and sponsoring agency will occur at least annually to include a review of these protocols.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.

Medical Specialist- Medication List selpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) 88.4.4 Medical Specialist Confined Space/Collapse Rescue Patient Medical Care 1. Perform an assessment of the scene, if not already done during the medical threat assessment: a. Determine scene hazards b. Survey the work environment for adequate oxygen levels, hazardous CO or gas levels and other hazardous materials around, lockout/tagout all utilities. Ideally, this should be done in conjunction with the incident HAZMAT team manager or Safety Officer. c. Assess weather and weather forecast. 2. Develop a medical care plan and prepare the appropriate needed supplies/equipment prior to entry “in the hole.” Planning should be performed in conjunction with the Task Force Leader (TFL) or Incident Commander (IC) and other USAR discipline-specific team leaders (i.e. Search, Rescue, HAZMAT, etc.). 3. Perform initial assessment on the total number of victims, locations and priority of care/ extrication. 4. Protect the patient from further injury as well as particulate inhalation – ear and eye protection, dust mask (particulate mask, N95 or P-100 mask, oxygen via NRB mask, etc.), helmet, heat/cold protection. Drop patient packs to the victim(s) if unable to access immediately. 5. Once access is gained to the victim, a Medical Specialist should perform an initial clinical assessment of general condition, vital signs and injuries. Initiate routine patient care as outlined in the Statewide Treatment Protocols. 6. Assess for any unrecognized hemorrhage and control all sources of severe bleeding. Use an approved tourniquet for life-threatening external hemorrhage that is anatomically amenable to tourniquet application or for any traumatic amputation. Apply the tourniquet over the clothing proximal to the bleeding site as high as possible, or if able to fully expose and evaluate the wound, apply directly to the skin 2-3 inches above the wound and do not apply over the joint. If a tourniquet is not needed, use other techniques to control bleeding. 7. The patient’s airway and breathing status should be assessed. If necessary, perform advanced airway management utilizing direct in-line cervical spine immobilization only as needed. Consider use of the Selective Spine Assessment Program (SSAP.) A supraglottic airway device may be used in place of endotracheal tube if intubation is not possible. 8. Begin cardiac monitoring. Record and interpret a baseline 12-lead EKG as soon as possible.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) 88.4.4 Medical Specialist Confined Space/Collapse Rescue Patient Medical Care, Continued 9. Obtain intravenous (IV) access and begin infusion of normal saline (NS). a. For signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock, administer a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal salline (NS.) b. In the absence of signs of hypovolemia, administer 2 mL/kg/hour infusion of NS. c. If unable to obtain IV access, establish an IO (if indicated) and begin NS infusion. 10. Re-assess the victim for any uncontrolled hemorrhage. If any tourniquets were placed earlier, they should be re-assessed for adequate hemorrhage control. Consider use of hemostatic gauze pressure dressing for exsanguinating wounds not amenable to tourniquet use. 11. If a victim is anticipated to need significant blood transfusion (for example: presents with hemorrhagic shock, one or more major amputations, penetrating torso trauma, or evidence of severe bleeding) and is within 3 hours from time of injury, administer tranexamic acid (TXA). 12. Assess for and treat potential hypoglycemia and dehydration. Consider oral hydration so long as the patient is can follow commands, alert and oriented, and a patent airway and gag reflex is present. This should be done only if a prolonged extrication is anticipated and there are no other means of fluid administration. Limit initial hydration to 16-32 ounces of potable water. 13. Assess and manage the victim for any evidence of entrapment or crush injury. Refer to the USAR Crush Injury / Crush Syndrome management protocol. 14. Monitor patient for hyperthermia or hypothermia. Preferably, a core temperature measurement should be obtained. Treat per Protocols 2.7 Hyperthermia (Environmental) and 2.8 Hypothermia (Environmental). 15. If available and trained to do so, draw blood sample and analyze blood chemistry using point-of-care testing. Continue analyzing and consult with an AHMD for further direction. 16. For pain management of the non-isolated extremity injury refer to the USAR Sedation and Analgesia protocol. 17. Re-assess the medical care plan with the AHMD and rescue team leader as appropriate.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Crush Injury/Crush Syndrome Management 1. Consider the use of an approved tourniquet to prevent reperfusion of a crushed limb prior to removal of compressive forces only if pre-treatment of the patient cannot be performed. 2. Initiation of fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS) should ideally occur prior to any extrication or release from compressive forces. Administer fluids at an initial rate of 1 L/hr (10-15 ml/kg/hr) for up to 2 L total. Subsequent fluid administration can be delivered at a rate up to 500 ml/hr (5-7 ml/kg/hr) up to 24 hours.\nCAUTION: Given the risk of hyperkalemia due to crush injury, potassium containing solutions (i.e. Lactated Ringers solution) should be avoided.\n3. For victims with prolonged crush (>1-2 hour) or at high risk of crush syndrome, initiate serum alkalinization prior to extrication. Sodium bicarbonate therapy should be goal directed based on available clinical data (i.e. urine output, hemodynamic parameters, evidence of hypocalcemia, etc.) and point-of-care testing (urine and serum pH, serum electrolyte levels, etc.). Consider alternating bicarbonate-containing fluids with NS to minimize volume overload. Medical Control should be consulted for any use of bicarbonate therapy. a. Add 150 mEq of 8.4% (1 mEq/ml) sodium bicarbonate into a 1 L D W bag 5 infused at a rate of 250-500 ml/hr. Remember to remove 150 ml of D W to 5 accommodate the sodium bicarbonate. This mixture provides a near “isotonic” solution capable of alkalinizing the bloodstream. b. If 1 L D W bags are not available, add 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate to 1 L 5 NS bag infused at a rate of 500 ml/hr. c. Bolus doses of sodium bicarbonate at 0.5 – 2 mEq/kg IV/IO in accordance with Protocol 4.7 Soft Tissue/Crush Injury can be administered if an infusion cannot be initiated. d. For pediatric patients, administer sodium bicarbonate infusion at the following rates: Up to 10 kg: 8 ml/kg/hr 10-20 kg: 80 ml/hr + 4 ml/kg/hr >20 kg: 160 ml/hr + 2 ml/kg/hr e. Consider placement of a urine bladder catheter to monitor urine output to a diuresis goal of >200-300 ml/hr (3-4 ml/kg/hr) or a urine pH of >6.5. 4. Re-assess the patient and coordinate extrication with technical rescue personnel. Be vigilant for sudden hypotension and hyperkalemic changes. Be prepared to control severe hemorrhage as well as the development of compartment syndrome if fluid begins to third space into injured tissue. 5. For patients with point of care values or EKG findings consistent with hyperkalemia refer to the Protocol 2.19 Hyperkalemia – Adult.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Hyperkalemia 1. Administer 1 gram of calcium chloride or calcium gluconate 10% (100 mg/ml) IV/IO bolus (20 mg/kg IV/IO for pediatric patient) over 2 minutes. Calcium chloride and calcium gluconate should not be routinely given to crush patients unless there is evidence of hyperkalemia (ECG changes, i-STAT confirmed).\nCAUTION: Do not administer calcium chloride and calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate in the same IV line as a salt may precipitate.\n2. Administer sodium bicarbonate 0.5 – 2 mEq/kg IV bolus. However, if the patient is already receiving large volumes of sodium bicarbonate as an infusion, contact Medical Control for further guidance. 3. Administer albuterol sulfate 0.083% up to 10 mg via inline nebulizer. 4. Administer 10 Units of regular insulin IV/IO followed by 50 ml of Dextrose 50% (25 gm/50 ml) IV OR Dextrose 10% IV/IO (25gm/250ml) for adult hyperkalemic patients with Medical Control. For pediatric patients, administer 0.1 Units/kg of regular insulin (up to 10 units) IV/IO bolus followed by D W 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg) IV bolus (infants) or 10 D W 0.5 -1 g/kg (2 – 4 mL/kg) IV/IO bolus (child). Blood glucose monitoring should be 25 repeated in 30 minutes and treated appropriately. 5. Contact Medical Control for furosemide 0.5-1 mg/kg IV/IO bolus.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Limb Injury/Compartment Syndrome 1. Control any life-threatening hemorrhage with tourniquets, direct pressure, hemostatic dressing and, assess distal CSM function and splint any obvious deformities. 2. Consider placing an approved tourniquet (do not tighten) as distal as possible near site of injury if there is potential for severe hemorrhage upon release of an entrapped limb. 3. Depending on the degree of tissue injury, bone involvement, duration of patient rescue and overall environmental conditions, tetanus and antibiotics administration may be indicated. Consult Medical Control for treatment options on specific antibiotic type and dosing. 4. Monitor closely for the development of compartment syndrome, especially in fixed muscle compartments such as the forearm or lower leg. Compartment syndrome is typically the result of muscle tissue swelling within the non-expansive fascial compartments which pressure rises greater than tissue perfusion pressure. 5. Palpate limbs carefully (especially where entrapped or laid upon) for firmness or functional loss. Some signs/symptoms to watch for include: a. PAIN out of proportion to physical examination. b. PALLOR of skin color c. PARESTHESIAS d. PARALYSIS e. PULSELESSNESS (This is often a late sign. The presence of a distal pulse does not rule out compartment syndrome) 6. Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation of the patient. 7. If compartment syndrome is recognized, immediately consult with a Medical Control regarding treatment options. Fasciotomy should NOT be routinely performed in the field due to technical difficulties, inadequate analgesia and high rates of wound infection.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Amputation 1. Amputation of a limb should ONLY be considered if there is an immediate threat to life as a LAST RESORT for freeing an entrapped victim, trading limb for life. An extreme circumstance is when it has been assessed that an entrapped limb is the ONLY remaining impediment to extricating an entrapped victim. 2. The decision to performing a field amputation should be made by a USAR team physician or AHMD (preferably on-scene) in coordination with a trauma surgeon whenever possible and in conjunction with the TFL or IC. The procedure should be ONLY performed by an appropriately trained physician. 3. Properly prepare the patient as much as time allows for amputation and immediate extrication – supplemental oxygen, end-tidal CO and cardiac monitoring, adequate IV 2 access, VS monitoring. Ensure all necessary equipment is nearby. 4. Expose the entrapped extremity as distally as possible 5. Place an approved tourniquet as distally as possibly, leaving just enough soft tissue to perform the amputation and should only be tightened prior to amputation under direction of medical control. 6. Administer the appropriate analgesia and sedation. 7. After the procedure has been completed, assess the limb for any re-bleeding (tourniquet tightening, additional tourniquet placement, bone marrow bleeding, etc.), dress the wound appropriately and consider the early administration of prophylactic antibiotics as directed by Medical Control.\nUrban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Procedural Sedation and Analgesia Adequate pain control is an integral component in effecting a successful victim rescue. Pharmacological agents available to the medical specialist should both be easy to titrate and have minimal impact on cardiorespiratory function. 1. Perform Confined Space/Collapse Rescue Patient Medical Care 2. Ensure that all appropriate monitoring (ECG monitoring, NIBP, pulse oximetry, ETCO , etc.) have been placed on the patient as feasibly possible given the 2 operational environment. 3. Moderate to severe pain can be managed in accordance with Protocol 2.13 Pain and Nausea Management – Adult & Pediatric. 4. For patients in pain that cannot be adequately controlled with the above agents, ketamine at a sub-dissociative dose repeated every 20-30 minutes until pain is controlled or the development of nystagmus: a. Adult: 10-20 mg IV/IO bolus or 50 mg IM b. Pediatric: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV/IO bolus or 0.4 mg/kg IM 5. In the event an emergent field procedure is to be performed (i.e. limb amputation, fracture/dislocation reduction, soft tissue injury repair, etc.), procedural sedation may be appropriate in order to achieve adequate operating conditions for the patient. A USAR team physician or AHMD MUST BE contacted prior to any sedation for procedures or extrication.\nNOTE: All appropriate monitoring equipment must be in place and applied as the situation dictates. Airway equipment and reversal agents should be ready at the bedside.\nselpicnirP dna Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist Medical Specialist- Medication List The use of these medications are governed by the USAR Protocols and applied in the context of a USAR operation by an authorized Medical Specialist in conjunction with Medical Control from a designated USAR Team Physician or AHMD.\nANTIBIOTICS\nCeftriaxone Cefazolin Levofloxacin Vancomycin\nOTHER MEDICATIONS\nKetamine Insulin – Regular Dextrose 5% in Water (D W) 5 Tranexamic Acid (TXA)",

Minimum Staffing, Training Requirements Minimum staffing at the Advanced Level requires one Advanced EMT and one EMT-Basic. Minimum staffing at the Paramedic level requires one Paramedic and one Advanced EMT/EMT- Basic, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.305(C)(2). EMS personnel providing patient care that exceed their regular scope of practice under the Statewide Treatment Protocols during basic and advanced life support (BLS/ALS) IFTs must meet the following requirements as outlined in 105 CMR 170.000 et al: a. current certification as an EMT in Massachusetts; b. completion of Department approved supplemental training that is specific to and consistent with levels of certification of involved EMTs and includes expanded roles and responsibilities additional, approved treatment modalities, equipment, devices, and technologies; and ambulance service policies and procedures regarding BLS and ALS IFT c. has maintained current authorization to practice pursuant to the Affiliate Hospital Medical Director’s review of clinical competency. It shall be the responsibility of the transferring ambulance service to ensure and to verify appropriate training of its IFT EMS personnel. This includes ensuring that all its IFT EMS personnel successfully have successfully completed IFT Initial training, and thereafter, refresher training at a minimum whenever new IFT equipment or medication is approved for use. 2. Affiliation Agreements; Medical Control An ambulance service must be licensed at an ALS level by the Department to provide ALS IFT care, and it must maintain an affiliation agreement, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.300, with a hospital licensed to provide Medical Control by the Department, pursuant to 105 CMR 130.1501-130.1504 of the Hospital Licensure regulations. Such affiliation agreements must designate an Affiliate Hospital Medical Director (105 CMR 170.300(A)(2) and 105 CMR 130.1502(C)), whose medical oversight functions are defined in 105 CMR 130.1503. Standards for Affiliate Hospital Medical Directors are defined in 105 CMR 130.1504. 3. Communications: All communications by radio or phone with a Medical Control physician must be recorded. 4. Scope of Practice: Section 170.360(A) of the EMS Regulations states, “No ambulance service or agent thereof shall transport a patient between health care facilities who is receiving medical treatment that is beyond the training and certification capabilities of the EMTs staffing the ambulance unless an additional health care professional with that capability accompanies the patient...” Depending on the patient’s condition, there may be situations in which a physician or another health care professional’s presence might be necessary; such determination shall be made by the Medical Control physician in consultation with the physician at the sending hospital.\ntraP\nTFI\nIFT Guidelines and Protocols A1 The scope of practice for each EMT level is defined (1) in regulation (105 CMR 170.810, 170.820 and 170.840), (2) by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National EMS Scope of Practice Model and as used in its National EMS Education Standards, and (3) through established training programs approved by the Department, and through the Statewide Treatment Protocols Appendix A1. The following are patient condition classifications and corresponding requirements for EMT personnel during ambulance transport: a. Stable Patient - Routine, scheduled transport; Patient clearly stable for transport with no requirement for airway management and no device in place that is actively running or requires any maintenance or monitoring and at no risk for deterioration. Patient may have a device in place, but device must be locked and clamped, not require any maintenance, and not be actively running. Such inactive devices may include, but are not limited to, IVs (if disconnected from fluid and on a saline lock during transport), nasogastric tubes, feeding tubes, PICC lines, bladder irrigation, and wound vacs (wound vacs that are self-contained, gravity draining or battery powered can be transported by BLS providers). Running PCA pumps are not inactive and require ALS (for exceptions-see note below). Note: This is the level of care needed for a patient with any device that will NOT require active intervention or management by BLS; unless ALS is otherwise required for patient management. If the device is being managed by the patient or accompanying caregiver, the patient or caregiver must have been trained in actually managing the device, NOT merely in its use; for example-the patient or caregiver must have the knowledge and ability to stop a PCA pump, if the line is damaged. Minimum Staffing: BLS licensed ambulance service; one EMT-Basic and one person trained to the first responder level. b. 1. Stable Patient at low risk of deterioration - Patient clearly stable for transport (as above) who has a “maintenance” IV running without additives; (e.g., cancer patient transported for radiation therapy, with unadulterated crystalloid IV solution running). Advanced EMTs may transport patients with Dextrose-containing IV solutions. Minimum Staffing: ALS-Advanced EMT licensed ambulance service; one Advanced EMT attending to patient care and one EMT-Basic driving 2. Stable patient with low risk of deterioration – Patient with an acute or subacute problem, who is stabilized, with a low potential to become less stable during transport. The patient specifically does not require cardiac rhythm monitoring but may be attached to a monitor for pulse rate monitoring under medical director option in A1. Medication running must be consistent with IFT MDO Protocol Part A1 if in use; i.e. antibiotics not by pump are permissible. Examples may include a patient with a hip fracture and dysrhythmia history who is not experiencing an uncontrolled or unstable dysrhythmia; or a patient with pneumonia and stable vital signs who is receiving IV antibiotics during transport. Minimum Staffing: ALS-Advanced EMT licensed ambulance service; one Advanced EMT attending patient care, who must be operating with permission under IFT MDO Protocol A1, and one EMT- Basic driving. c. Stable patient with medium risk or deterioration – Patient with an acute or subacute problem, who is either completely or, at least, to the best of a facility’s ability, stabilized; who has the potential to become less stable during transport. Instrumentation or medication running must be consistent with IFT Guidelines. This is the minimum level for running PCA pumps. Minimum Staffing: ALS-Paramedic licensed ambulance service; one EMT-Paramedic and one Advanced EMT or EMT-Basic, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.305(C)(2). The EMT with the highest level of certification must attend to patient care.\ntraP\nTFI\nA1 IFT Guidelines and Protocols d. Patient with high risk of deterioration or unstable - Patient with an acute problem with high potential to become unstable or cannot be stabilized at the sending facility - Critical Care patient. Critical care patients require critical care transport (CCT). See Part B, Determining the Need for CCT. Minimum Staffing: CCT licensed ambulance service. In the event that CCT is unavailable, the sending facility must send appropriate additional medical personnel (per 105 CMR 170.360(A)) to accompany the patient during transfer and assume responsibility for patient care, in an ambulance staffed with a minimum two paramedics. e. Critical Care Transports (see 105 CMR 170.000, for regulatory requirements regarding critical care transport). Note: The sending hospital’s medical personnel, such as a nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist (the latter for ventilator management only) accompanying the patient must be able to manage all equipment and instrumentation associated with the patient’s care and provide advanced resuscitative measures if needed. Such sending of hospitals additional health care professionals would be responsible for primary patient care of that patient during transport and would receive additional orders from the sending physician, since the care of the patient exceeds what the ambulance and its EMS personnel could provide. Note: Under no circumstances shall EMTs function or be assigned to transfers beyond, or potentially beyond, the scope of their training and level of certification. The scope of practice for all EMTs is limited to the levels of EMT certification and training and by licensure level of the ambulance service by which they are employed.\ntraP\nTFI\nIFT Guidelines and Protocols As a measure of last resort, in exceptional cases where CCT is unavailable and sending facility staff is unavailable, and the patient has a medical condition requiring time-sensitive intervention, and it is approved by the Medical Control physician, the patient may be transferred by any level of certified EMS personnel; provided that all interventions are within the scope of practice of the transporting EMTs and the licensed vehicle. The Medical Control physician and sending physician must be in direct communication if there are any concerning issues prior to patient transport. In these cases, the sending facility/physician must demonstrate he/she made every effort to secure a CCT-licensed ambulance, and failing that, to send appropriate hospital personnel and the patient condition is such that it is truly time sensitive that the patient be transferred to another hospital for appropriate care. All such cases must be reported to the Affiliate Hospital Medical Director of the ambulance service that provides the transport, for quality assurance review. A hospital may NOT have a policy permitting this type of transport as a standard option. If may only be used as a real-time Medical Control decision, and reported as above. 5. Continuous Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement a. Ambulance services providing ALS IFT shall be required to have continuous quality assurance/quality improvement (CQI/QI) policies specific to ALS IFT in conjunction with both their affiliate hospital medical directors and their ambulance service medical directors, if any, and include at a minimum: review of appropriateness of transfers, denials, and conformance with EMTALA regulations; review of critical skills (e.g., intubations, cardiac arrest management, IV therapy), and other measures of system function as deemed appropriate by the Department; steps for system improvement and individual remediation, available for Department review, of cases found to be deficient in critical interventions Patient ALS Transfer Procedure Once an ALS IFT has been deemed appropriate by the transferring ambulance service (see “Scope of Practice” above), paramedic staff, upon arrival at the transferring facility, will: receive a report from the staff of the transferring facility assess the patient; and in cases where the patient’s care during the transfer exceeds the standing-order scope of practice for an EMT-Paramedic or is unstable or is likely to become unstable as defined previously (see “Scope of Practice” above) will provide a concise, complete and accurate patient report to an Medical Control physician, according to the EMS service’s and the Affiliate Hospital’s policies and procedures. When EMS personnel have a concern regarding the safety of the patient being transferred, the Paramedic will contact an Medical Control physician for guidance. The report should include, at a minimum, the following information: a. Names of transferring and receiving facilities b. Patient’s diagnosis c. Reason(s) for transfer d. Brief history of present illness and any intervention(s) which has occurred to date e. Pertinent physical findings f. Vital signs g. Current medications and IV infusions h. Presence of or need for additional medical personnel traP\nTFI\nA1 IFT Guidelines and Protocols traP\nTFI\nIFT Guidelines and Protocols i. Anticipated problems during transport, if any j. Anticipated transport time; and k. Staffing configuration of the transporting ambulance\nNOTE: Complete copies of all pertinent medical records, including X-Rays, CT Scans, consultative notes and ECGs, as available, must accompany the patient to the receiving facility either electronically or in-hand. When necessary, the Medical Control physician and paramedic will discuss with the sending physician the orders for maintenance of existing and/or addition of new therapies according to the needs of the patient, within the scope of existing treatment protocols and EMT scope of practice. The Medical Control physician will be responsible for all actions/interventions initiated by the EMS personnel during transport unless the referring physician accompanies the patient. If the sending physician is unavailable, or the patient is unstable, the Medical Control physician may recommend to the sending facility additional therapies prior to the transfer of the patient in the interest of patient safety and quality care. In some situations, consistent with the intent of EMTALA, the transfer of a patient not stabilized for transport may be preferable to keeping that patient at a facility incapable of providing stabilizing care. If the transferring facility cannot provide appropriate medical care or appropriately trained and experienced personnel to accompany the patient, alternative means of transfer, including a CCT- licensed ambulance service, must be utilized. The use of a local primary ambulance service is strongly discouraged in such a situation. All such responses must be reported by the ambulance service to the Department’s Division of Health Care Facility Licensure and Certification for review. It is ultimately the responsibility of the sending physician and Medical Control physician to determine the appropriate method of transferring any patient, including an unstable patient who needs interventions not otherwise available.\nNOTE: An ambulance service may not unilaterally change the level of staffing and care provided. While traP\nTFI\nIFT Guidelines and Protocols A1 Interstate ALS IFT: During interstate IFTs, paramedics must obtain Medical Control through the normal channels of the ambulance service for which they are working. Appropriate provisions for re- contacting the Medical Control Physician during transport, if necessary, should be made prior to departure from the sending facility. If a transfer originates out of state and no contact with a Medical Control Physician is possible, the transfer should be made at the BLS level only with appropriate additional personnel provided by the sending facility. Part A1 – Medical Director Option (MDO) for ALS IFT Staffing: Advanced EMTs (AEMT) may be specifically trained under the supervision of their ambulance service’s Affiliate Hospital Medical Director (AHMD) to add the following skills for IFT use only: 1. Application of a 3- or 4-lead cardiac monitor to a patient. The AEMT is NOT interpreting the cardiac rhythm: They may acquire recordings, transmit the rhythm strip, or otherwise maintain it for physician evaluation. The pulse rate is to be monitored as a continuous vital sign. 2. Monitoring of running IV antibiotic-containing ONLY solutions, not on an infusion pump. Each service in which MDO has been adopted is responsible to maintain records of such training AND forward them in writing to OEMS, specifying the service, approving AHMD, which AEMTs have been trained, and when, by name. In addition, each service that adopts this MDO must report in writing to OEMS the start date of implementation and must report total number of uses of this MDO at the six- month mark and the one-year mark from implementation. Such records and reports must be submitted to the State EMS Medical Director and OEMS Clinical Coordinator. Any adverse event that occurs during a transport using this IFT MDO protocol MUST be reported within 48 hours by email to the State EMS Medical Director and the OEMS Clinical Coordinator. Adverse events include, but are not limited to, needing a paramedic intercept; needing to change hospital destination en route for a clinical reason; patient deterioration, or patient death. Any result of transport other than an uneventful IFT is typically an adverse event.\nB traP\n,1A secidneppA ALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part B- Determining the need for CCT B1 – Pediatric Patients (14 years of age or younger and/or weighing no more than 40kg) Any neonate (30 days or younger) requiring transfer for evaluation and/or treatment of an UNSTABILIZED acute condition. Any pediatric patient with critical illness or injury.\nNOTE: Medical Control should be involved in determining whether pediatric patients require critical care.\nAny pathology associated with the potential for imminent upper airway collapse and / or obstruction (including but not limited to airway burns, toxic inhalation, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, etc.). If any concerns whether patient falls into this category, contact Medical Control. Any pediatric patient requiring acute ventilatory support (NIV, high flow NC, ventilator, etc.) who requires an interfacility transfer. For patients 2 months or older, Paramedic transport may be indicated in place of CCT for patients requiring hi flow nasal cannula if the patient is receiving an FiO2 <50% or less and has an SpO2 of ≥ 92% and is stable on such settings for 20 minutes. Such transport must be agreed to by sending physician and Medical Control. All conditions that apply to adult medical patients also require CCT for the pediatric patient.\nNOTE: Medical Control should be involved in determining whether pediatric patients require critical care.\nB2 – ADULT PATIENTS\nUnless approved by Medical Control, patients requiring more than three (3) medication infusions by IV pump, not including maintenance fluids must be transported by CCT.\n• Unless approved by Medical Control, any patient receiving more than one IV medication being actively titrated to affect heart rate or blood pressure must be transported by CCT. Any patient who is being actively paced (either transvenous or transcutaneous) must be transported by CCT. Patients being transferred due to an issue with a ventricular assist device that may require active monitoring or management. Patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump. Any patients with a pulmonary artery catheter.\nNOTE: Central lines may be transported by ALS IFT\nA-line monitoring on an uncomplicated stable patient can be transported by a paramedic level IFT crew. All paramedics doing so must be properly trained in this skill, and the AHMD must approve of the training and skill use. All such instances also must be reviewed by the AHMD for quality assurance purposes. Patients with high potential for being unstable must be transported by CCT and not IFT. Any patient with an intracranial device requiring active monitoring.\nNOTE: Except for chronic use devices, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, etc.\nAny pathology associated with the potential for imminent upper airway collapse and / or obstruction (including but not limited to airway burns, toxic inhalation, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, etc.).\nNOTE: If any concerns about whether patient falls into this category, contact Medical\nControl.\nAny patient being artificially ventilated for ARDS or Acute Lung Injury.\nPart C – General Protocols for ALS IFT Care Vital signs should be obtained and documented every ten (10) minutes, unless otherwise required by protocol. • If clinically indicated, patients will have continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) and / or pulse oximetry (SpO2). • All artificially ventilated patients (and all other patients where it is clinically indicated) will have continuous monitoring of waveform capnography. The recommended route for medication infusions in the ALS IFT setting is the peripheral intravenous (IV) line. Intraosseous (IO) lines may also be used. • Medications may also be administered through any central venous catheter • Paramedics may administer medication boluses, infusions and fluids through administration sets connected by the sending facility to subcutaneous devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath) ALS IFT patients should have IV access, if possible. • Paramedics should attempt to establish IV access if no attempts have been made at the sending facility. • Paramedics are authorized to establish IO access if warranted by the patient’s condition. All monitoring and therapy will be continued until care is transferred to the receiving medical staff. Paramedics may not accept any medications from the sending facility for the purposes of bolus administration during transport. Any patient who qualifies for spinal immobilization in accordance with Protocol 4.8 Spinal Chord and Column Injuries who has not been cleared by CT scan or appropriate physician assessment must be properly immobilized for transport. If there is identification of a clinical concern of thoracic or lumbosacral spine injury, the patient should be immobilized to the stretcher to ensure minimal movement. • If any confusion arises regarding the need for spinal immobilization Medical Control will be contacted and the Medical Control physician and the sending physician should be in direct communication. Paramedics must be familiar with the treatments and interventions instituted at sending facility. Patient care documentation should include, at a minimum: • Patient’s diagnosis / reason for transfer • Brief history of present illness / injury • Brief overview of interventions performed by sending facility • Pertinent physical examination findings and recent vital signs • Current medications and IV infusions • Presence of or need for additional medical personnel For all patients being transferred to an emergency department, who are critically ill, unstable, or have a change in clinical status, EMTs should notify receiving emergency department via CMED prior to arrival. If local CMED is unavailable, entry notes should be made by telephone (on a recorded line, if possible). Paramedics will contact Medical Control for: • Any intervention(s) that exceed the standing order scope of practice as defined by the current version of the Massachusetts Pre-Hospital Statewide Treatment Protocols for a Paramedic. • Any patient that is unstable or is likely to become unstable. • When there is any concern regarding the safety of the patient being transferred. • Any significant patient care related questions or issues prior to transfer or enroute. Paramedics can facilitate communication between the Medical Control and sending physician if there are any concerning issues prior to patient transport.\nC traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols General Protocols for ALS IFT Care  It is recommended that central access and / or two large bore IV lines are in place prior to transport.  Care during transport: (cid:31) Administer high-flow supplemental oxygen (cid:31) Continuous cardiac monitoring (cid:31) Heart rate, blood pressure, neurologic evaluations documented every 5 – 10 minutes (cid:31) Target heart rate = 60 – 80 bpm (cid:31) Target systolic blood pressure = 90 – 100 mm Hg (cid:31) Continually assess mentation. (cid:31) If patient is outside of these parameters, contact Medical Control. (cid:31) Administer fentanyl for analgesia, per Protocol 2.13 Pain & Nausea Management Adult & Pediatric or by orders.  If not approved by Medical Control prior to transport, you must contact Medical Control to adjust all medication infusions: (cid:31) Adjust vasoactive medications initiated at sending facility (until systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mm Hg and/or MAP is less than 60 mm Hg): (cid:31) If labetalol infusion has been initiated by sending facility, increase by 2 mg / minute every 10 minutes (to a maximum of 8 mg/minute) (cid:31) If esmolol infusion has been initiated by sending facility, increase by 50 mcg / kg / minute every 4 minutes (to a maximum of 300 mcg / kg / minute) (cid:31) If nitroprusside infusion has been initiated by sending facility, increase by 0.5 mcg / kg / minute every 5 minutes (to a maximum of 4 mcg / kg / minute) (cid:31) If nicardipine has been initiated by sending facility; (cid:31) Increase by 2.5 mg / hour every 5 minutes (to a maximum of 15 mg / hour). Discontinue drip and contact Medical Control for instructions if: (cid:31) Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, or; (cid:31) Heart rate < 60 bpm (cid:31) If no medication infusion has been initiated to control blood pressure and / or heart rate, Medical Control may order the administration of metoprolol 5 mg IV every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg.\n1D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D1 – Aortic Dissection Symptoms of a Transfusion Reaction Acute Hemolytic Reaction Fever, hypotension, flushing, wheezing, dark and / or red colored urine, oozing from IV sites, joint pain, back pain, chest tightness Nonhemolytic Febrile Reaction Fever, chills, rigors, vomiting, hypotension Allergic Reaction Urticaria, hives (usually without fever or hypotension) Anaphylactic Reaction Dyspnea, wheezing, anxiety, hypotension, bronchospasm, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea Volume Overload Dyspnea, hypoxia, rales, tachycardia, jugular vein distention Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (“TRALI”) Dyspnea, hypoxia, rales (usually without fever or signs of pulmonary edema)  STOP the infusion if any of the above symptoms are discovered!  Start infusion of normal saline  Contact Medical Control  Treat hypotension and anaphylactic reaction with standing orders (Statewide Treatment Protocols)  If minor allergic reaction (urticaria / wheezing) administer diphenhydramine, 50 mg IV  If SpO2 is below 90% or patient experiences wheezing / rales, administer high-flow supplemental oxygen and consider positive pressure ventilation. If significant signs of volume overload, consider furosemide, 40 mg IV.  Notify issuing hospital’s blood bank of any suspected reaction. All documentation and blood supplies used (tubing, bag, etc.) from the blood given must stay with the patient and be transferred to the receiving hospital staff on patient turnover.\n2D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D2- Blood Transfusion Reaction  Seizures (either generalized motor or nonconvulsive) should be quickly controlled. • After assessing airway, breathing, and applying high-flow oxygen:\n• Follow Seizure protocols: Protocol 2.15A Seizures – Adult and 2.15P Seizures - Pediatric  For an ischemic CVA, if a tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) infusion will be continued during the transport, follow these guidelines: • Sending facility staff should withdraw excess tPA from the bottle, so that the bottle will be empty once the full dose has infused. Example: 100 mg bottle of tPA contains 100 mL of fluid when reconstituted; if the total dose being administered is 70 mg, then the facility should remove 30 mL of fluid from the bottle before departure. • When the pump alarm indicates that the bottle is empty, you should take the following steps to ensure that the drug contained within the administration tubing is administered to the patient:\n• Remove the IV tubing from the tPA bottle and spike a bag of 0.9% NS and restart the infusion; the pump will stop infusing when the preset volume has been administered.  If systolic blood pressure is found to be greater than 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure is found to be greater than 105 mm Hg consult Medical Control, then: • Adjust antihypertensive medications initiated at sending facility:\n• If labetalol has been initiated by sending facility;  Increase by 2 mg/minute every 10 minutes (to a maximum of 8 mg/minute) until systolic blood pressure is less than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure is less than 105 mm Hg  Discontinue drip and contact Medical Control for instructions if the reduction in MAP is greater than 30% of initial BP or SBP < 140 mm Hg, DBP < 80, or heart rate < 60 bpm\n• If nicardipine has been initiated by sending facility;  Increase by 2.5 mg / hour every 5 minutes (to a maximum of 15 mg / hour) until systolic blood pressure is less than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure is less than 105 mm Hg  Discontinue drip and contact Medical Control for instructions if the reduction in MAP is greater than 30% of initial BP or SBP < 140 mm Hg, DBP < 80, or heart rate < 60 bpm  For any acute worsening of neurologic condition (e.g., acutely worsening neurological deficits, development of severe headache, acute hypertension, vomiting, etc.): • If patient is receiving tPA, discontinue the infusion. • Contact Medical Control for further instructions, including possible change in destination. • Contact receiving hospital emergency department with an update on patient’s condition and an estimated time of arrival.\n3D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D3 – CVA Post tPA  If post-arrest targeted temperature management (TTM) therapy in progress at the time of ALS IFT arrival, it should be continued during the transport per Protocol 3.7 Targeted Temperature Management  Pre-transport temperature should be documented, and temperature should be monitored with vital signs every five minutes.  The temperature target for post-arrest targeted temperature management (TTM) is 32°C – 36°C\n(89.6°F – 96.8°F).\n If pre-transport or inter-transport temperature is less than or equal to 36°C:\n• Maintain temperature with cold packs placed in the groin, axillae, and on the chest and sides of neck.  If pre-transport or inter-transport temperature is greater than 36°C: • Continue cooling with cold packs placed in the groin, axillae, and on the chest and sides of neck.  Temperature should be monitored if possible for transport times longer than 20 minutes. Patients should be handled gently (due to risk of arrhythmias).  ALS IFT crews will not discontinue TTM unless ordered to do so by Medical Control.  If patient temperature is less than 31°C, contact Medical Control and utilize any external warming devices (blankets, etc.) to actively rewarm patient until the temperature is greater than\n31°C.\n• If ordered by Medical Control and available, consider infusion of 250 mL IV boluses of warmed normal saline solution, until the temperature is greater than 31°C.  If hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias or bradycardia of any type develop, or if the patient develops significant bleeding, TTM should be stopped, Medical Control contacted, and active rewarming pursued.\n4D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D4- Post-Arrest Targeted Temperature A1 Management (TTM)  Patients who are in labor with concern for imminent delivery must be accompanied by sending facility staff.  In high-risk situations, a physician / registered nurse will accompany the patient for transport.  If any confusion arises regarding the need for additional OB staff Medical Control will be contacted and the Medical Control physician and sending physician should be in direct communication.  In addition to the documentation standards listed in the General ALS IFT Care Guidelines, when transporting an obstetrical patient, the following should be documented: • The presence of a fetal heart rate before and after transfer • Estimated date of confinement, maternal history of any complications • Condition of membranes, dilation • Gravida / Para • Timing and nature of contractions • Fetal Position  Patients should be transported in a left-lateral position or sitting upright, if possible.  Document that the fetal heart rate was evaluated prior to transport and upon arrival.  If patient should develop eclamptic seizures: • After assessing airway, breathing, and applying high-flow oxygen:\n• Administer magnesium sulfate 2-4 grams over 5 minutes IV/IO.\nFollow Protocol 2.15A – Seizures-Adult and the Protocol 2.10 Obstetrical Emergencies\n5D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D5 – Pregnancy Related  Paramedics should be familiar with the care and treatment the patient has received. Confirm medications administered prior to arrival.  Consider discontinuing or avoiding all medication infusions (except for basic IV fluids) to expedite transfer.  Receiving facility should be contacted to ensure rapid transfer to cardiac cath lab.  Patients should receive appropriate supplemental oxygen therapy, only if SpO2 <90% or dyspnea, in accordance with 1.0 Routine Patient Care.  All other interventions per the Statewide Treatment Protocols, if not already administered: • Aspirin, 324-325 mg PO  If patient continues to experience chest discomfort: • Nitroglycerine (if systolic blood pressure is greater than 120 mm Hg), 0.4 mg SL tablet or spray; may be repeated in 5 minute intervals for a total of three (3) doses • Fentanyl, 1 mcg/kg slow IV/IO/IM/IN (initial dose) to a max. of 150mcg; if needed, may repeat up to two additional doses, 5-minutes apart, not to exceed a total max dose of 450mcg (including initial dose.)\n6D traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part D6- ST-Segment Elevation MI (STEMI)  The transport paramedic must be familiar or become familiar through consultation (i.e., with a drug reference or discussion with hospital staff) on the following attributes of each drug the patient has received prior to and will receive during transport: • The type and name of medication being administered. • The indication and contraindications for administration of the medication. • The correct dose, rate, and mixture of medication. • Any titration indications or instructions. • Any specific Medical Control instructions. • Any patient-specific information • Any adverse effects of the medication being administered. • The seven rights of medication administration should always be considered, even when transporting patients between facilities.  Right patient, drug, dose, route, time, outcome, documentation.  Paramedics may not accept any medications from the sending facility for the purposes of bolus administration during transport.\n1E traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part E1- General Guidelines for Medication Administration Any of the following medications or medication classes, not currently part of the Paramedic Statewide Treatment Protocols, may be maintained if initiated at the sending facility, and can only be titrated through specific IFT protocols and by Medical Control. Aminophylline Analgesics Anticonvulsants Antidotes Antidysrhythmics Antihypertensive agents Anti-infectives (e.g., antibiotics, anti-sepsis) Benzodiazepines Blood products Chemotherapeutic agents Electrolyte infusions  Potassium, limited to 10 mEq / hour  Magnesium, maintenance infusion limited to 2 g / hour Glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors Heparin 3% Hypertonic Saline Insulin infusions Intravenous steroids Inhaled or nebulized medications Mannitol infusions Octreotide Paralytics Parenteral nutrition Proton Pump Inhibitors Sedatives Standard IV infusion fluids (including 10% Dextrose) Thrombolytic agents Vasodilators (including all forms of Nitroglycerin) Vasopressors\n2E traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part E2 Approved Medications and Classes\nNOTE: All medication infusions other than standard crystalloids and blood products must be administered by IV infusion pump.\nInfusion/bloodbank documentation must be transported with the patient.\nParamedics will not initiate a blood product infusion.\nAt least one additional IV line should be in place.\nParamedic will not administer any medications through an IV line which is being used to infuse blood or a blood product. Ensure the blood and / or blood products are infusing at the prescribed rate. Monitor and record the patient’s vital signs every 5 – 10 minutes. If any signs and symptoms of transfusion reaction, proceed immediately to D2-Blood Transfusion Reaction of this protocol. When the transfusion has finished: (cid:31) Record transfusion end-time and post-infusion vital signs. (cid:31) Disconnect infusion set tubing from primary line. (cid:31) Flush primary line with normal saline only. (cid:31) Place any used supplies into a clean biohazard marked container or bag. (cid:31) All documentation and blood supplies used (tubing, bag, etc) from the blood given must stay with the patient and be transferred to the receiving hospital at patient turnover.\n3E traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part E3 Blood and / or Blood-Product Administration All artificially ventilated patients must be transferred on a ventilator. Consider sedation/analgesia; remember that paralysis is not sedation. All ventilators must be able to meet the demands of the patient’s condition, taking into consideration all settings and features described or stipulated by the sending facility and / or physician. Ventilators may not be full control mode only and must be capable of meeting the patient’s ventilatory needs. Ventilator settings must be documented on Patient Care Report. Unless the transfer is time sensitive in nature (e.g., STEMI, aortic dissection, acute CVA, unstable trauma, etc.), the following requirements apply to ventilator use and / or adjustment: • Patients must be observed, by the sending facility, for a minimum of 20 minutes after any adjustment in ventilator settings. • Patients should be on the transport ventilator for 20 minutes prior to departure. • Medical Control may waive 20 minute rule based on patient condition and needs. If waived, reason must be documented on Patient Care Report. Medical Control is required for any instance when adjustment of the ventilator settings is needed.\n1F traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part F1- Mechanical Ventilation Paramedics who operate at the ALS IFT level are expected to have a thorough understanding of the functions and operations of the infusion pump they will utilize (whether property of the ambulance service or sending facility). Paramedics are expected to not only control the basic functions of the pump, but also be able to dynamically troubleshoot pump issues. Prior to transport, paramedics must be proficient at the following: How to turn the pump on and off. How to load and safely eject the administration set into pump. The importance of having spare tubing. How to suspend pump operation. How to adjust the infusion rate, if necessary. How to clear air bubbles from the tubing. How to troubleshoot problems (e.g., occlusion alarms). How the specific service addresses low battery or power issues.\n2F traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part F2 Intravenous Pumps Obtain and document the indication for placement of the pleural chest tube. Ensure that the chest tube is secured to the patient, and that the drainage system remains in an upright position and below the level of the patient’s chest at all times. Regularly evaluate lung sounds and vital signs. • Signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax include: Dyspnea, tachypnea, decreased / absent lung sounds on affected side, hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation (late sign) Tubes and connections should be evaluated following any movement of the patient to ensure leak-proof operation and chest tube patency. Check the following initially and after moving the patient: • Ensure the dressing remains dry and occlusive. • Ensure there are no kinks or dependent loops (e.g., a loop or turn in the tubing that forces the drainage to move against gravity to reach the collection chamber) in the tubing. • Amount of water in the water seal chamber; if the water level appears low ask a staff member if it requires refilling prior to departure. Monitor the following items after routine assessment of patient’s vital signs: • Drainage (document the appearance and amount of fluid, at the start and at the conclusion of transport) • Bubbling in the water seal chamber • Gentle rise and fall of the water level, which corresponds with the patient’s respirations is called “tidalling” and indicates that the system is functioning properly. Troubleshooting / problems  Abnormal bubbling in the water seal chamber • Remember, gentle rise and fall of the water level, which corresponds with the patient’s respirations is called “tidalling” and indicates that the system is functioning properly. • Continuous air bubbling confirms a constant air leak from a tube connection or from the patient's chest (e.g., unresolved pneumothorax). • Intermittent bubbling confirms an intermittent air leak from the patient's chest. • No air bubbling confirms no air leak from the patient's chest and no air leak from a tube connection.  If the entire chest tube is removed from the chest: Cover with a three-sided dressing and contact Medical Control.  If the chest drainage system tips over and spills: Contact Medical Control; you may be instructed to clamp tube.  If the chest drainage system is crushed or broken open, or the chest drain becomes detached from the chest tube: Contact Medical Control immediately, do not reconnect; you may be instructed to place the end of the chest tube in a bottle of sterile water to create a seal.\n3F traP\nTFI\nALS Interfacility Transfer Protocols Part F3 Pleural Chest Tube Monitoring",
